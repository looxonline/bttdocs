The first parameter represents the direction of the accelerometer module corresponding to the axis when the printer's X-axis moves in the positive direction (the silk screen on the module shows the direction of each axis of the module), and the second parameter represents the direction of the accelerometer when the Y-axis moves in the positive direction. \u200b 6.After configuring and installing the module and successfully connecting to the printer, you can start the resonance compensation test. Follow the instructions in the link below to start testing: https://www.klipper3d.org/G-Codes.html#shaper_calibrate In Mainsail's Console, enter the following command to start X axis calibration: SHAPER_CALIBRATE AXIS=X Enter the following command to start Y axis calibration: SHAPER_CALIBRATE AXIS=Y After calibration is complete, follow the prompts and enter SAVE_CONFIG to save the calibration parameters. Note: After the resonance compensation test, the module can be removed. The module configuration needs to be commented out in the \"printer.cfg\" file, otherwise the printer will fail to start if it cannot find the module. Comment out the module configuration by adding \"#\" in front of the config file name: # [include sample-bigtreetech-adxl345-v2.0.cfg] Assembly \u00b6 Note: Avoid overtightening screws during installation to prevent damage.

WiFi Settings \u00b6 After the OS writes to the SD card, there is a FAT32 partition named BOOT , open system.cfg file with Notpad , Notpad++ or VSCode . Set WIFI_SSID as your actual wifi name and WIFI_PASSWD as your actual wifi password, The space character can be parsed normally without additional escape character. For example: WIFI_SSID=\"CB1 Tester\" Overlays Settings \u00b6 After the OS writes to the SD card, there is a FAT32 partition named BOOT , open BoardEnv.txt file with Notpad , Notpad++ or VSCode . Set as required as shown in the figure below. The default value is console=display , This means that the UART0 of CB1 is used as the debugging port by default. We can use MobaXterm to connect to CB1 by UART0 and debug. If klipper wants to use UART0 to control the motherboard, we need to set it to console=serial , now klippe can use UART0 as /dev/ttyS0 . CB1 will automatically identify the HDMI resolution, but if your HDMI screen cannot report the resolution through the EDID normally, we can forcibly specify the resolution of CB1 output by uncomment extraargs=video and set the actual resolution. For example: BTT-HDMI7 resolution = 1024x600: extraargs=video=HDMI-A-1:1024x600-24@60 BTT-HDMI5 resolution = 800x480: extraargs=video=HDMI-A-1:800x480-24@60 Uncomment overlays=tft35_spi to enable TFT35 SPI screen. Uncomment overlays=mcp2515 to enable MCP2515 spi to canbus module. Uncomment overlays=tft35_spi mcp2515 If you want to use both TFT35 SPI screen and MCP2515 spi to canbus module uncomment the following overlays and parameters to release 'spidev1.1' to user space, And 'spidev1.1' cannot be used together with TFT35_SPI and MCP2515. overlays=spi-spidev param_spidev_spi_bus=1 param_spidev_spi_cs=1 param_spidev_max_freq=1000000 NOTE: TFT35 SPI and MCP2515 multiplex a group of SPI1 SPI1_CLK=PH6 SPI1_MISO=PH8 SPI1_MOSI=PH7 TFT35_SPI_CS=PC7 MCP2515_CS=PC11 MCP2515_IRQ=PC9 SSH Connection \u00b6 Install the ssh application Mobaxterm: https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html Insert the Micro SD card (installed OS) to motherboard, wait for system to load after power on, aprox. 1-2min. the ACT LED on the motherboard will flash continuously after startup successfully.

Releasing the button allows for programming the EMMC using the RKDevTool. 40 pin GPIO \u00b6 The calculation method for GPIO pins is as follows: GPIO4_B2 = (GPIO4 - GPIO0) * 32 + (\u2018B\u2019 - \u2018A\u2019) * 8 + 2 = 4 * 32 + 1 * 8 + 2 = gpio138 GPIO3_D7 = (GPIO3 - GPIO0) * 32 + (\u2018D\u2019 - \u2018A\u2019) * 8 + 7 = 3 * 32 + 3 * 8 + 7 = gpio127 Flashing the System \u00b6 Download the System Image \u00b6 Only use the image provided in the link: https://github.com/bigtreetech/CB2/releases Write System to MicroSD Card \u00b6 1\u3001Download the balenaEtcher software from [ https://www.balena.io/etcher/ ], install, and run it. 2\u3001Insert the MicroSD card via a card reader. 3\u3001Select your downloaded image. 4\u3001Select the MicroSD card and click \"Flash\" (WRITE the image will format the MicroSD card. Be careful not to select the wrong storage device, otherwise the data will be formatted). 5\u3001Wait for the process to complete. Writing System onto eMMC \u00b6 Using RKDevTool to Write the eMMC (Windows) Download and unzip RKDevTool from the GitHub repository ( https://github.com/bigtreetech/CB2 ) to your computer. DO NOT insert a MicroSD card. 1\u3001Turn the DIP switch 4 (USBOTG) and 3 (RPIBOOT) to the ON position to enter BOOT mode. 2\u3001Then, connect the Type-C cable to the computer. 3\u3001Install the driver: \u200b \u2460 In \u201cDevice Manager\u201d, if you see \u201cUnknown Device\u201d, it indicates that the computer is missing drivers. \u200b \u2461 Open the DriverAssistant tool in the downloaded RKDevTool folder, click \u201c\u2460Uninstall Driver\u201d, then click \u201c\u2461 Install Driver\u201d to ensure that the latest version of the driver is installed. \u2462After the installation is complete, hold down the \u201cRecovery\u201d button, replug the Type-C cable. \"Device Manager\" should now recognize a \u201cRockusb Device\u201d, indicating that the driver installation is successful. \u200b \u2463Open the \u201cRKDevTool\u201d software: Note: The parameters in the software are set by default as shown in the image. Normally, you only need to set the \u201c\u2463 actual path of the .img system\u201d. If the parameters in your software do not match those in the image, manually adjust them to match. \u2460Find the path where the downloaded RKDevTool is located. \u2461Open the RKDevTool tool. \u2462The software will recognize a \u201cLOADER\u201d or \u201cMASKROOM\u201d device. \u2463Select the system to be written (the OS image must be unzipped as a .img file beforehand; RKDevTool does not support directly writing compressed .xz files). \u2464Check \u201cWrite by Address\u201d. \u2465Click \u201cRun\u201d to start writting the system. \u2466\u201cDownload image OK\u201d indicates that the system has been successfully burned. 5\u3001After writing is complete, toggle the USB OTG switch to the OFF position to boot normally. Note: Files on the eMMC cannot be accessed by the computer like those on a MicroSD card, so you cannot modify the system.cfg configuration file to set up the WiFi network. Instead, use an Ethernet cable or USB-to-UART connection to configure the terminal. Writing System onto eMMC Using a MicroSD Card \u00b6 1\u3001First, write the system onto the MicroSD card. Then, insert the MicroSD card into the motherboard's card slot and wait for the system to boot. 2\u3001Connect to the system terminal via Ethernet cable, WiFi, or USB to UART, and log in to the system. login: biqu password: biqu Execute the command sudo nand-sata-install. In the interface that pops up, select \"2 Boot From eMMC - system on eMMC\" and then select \"OK\" \u2460Select \"Yes\" to start erasing and writing the system onto the eMMC. \u2461Choose the filesystem \"1 ext4\" and then select \"OK\". \u2462Wait for the writing process to complete. \u2463Upon completion, you will be prompted whether to power off. Select \u201cPower off\u201d to shut down the system. \u2464After the system has powered down, disconnect the power supply, remove the MicroSD card, and then reconnect power. The system should now boot from the eMMC. Erasing eMMC \u00b6 When using a MicroSD card as the system card instead, it's best to erase the data on the eMMC to prevent the motherboard from booting from it by mistake. Using RKDevTool to Erase eMMC (Windows) \u00b6 1\u3001Refer to the steps in \"4.3.1 Using RKDevTool to Write the eMMC (Windows)\" to connect the motherboard to the computer. 2\u3001Open the \"RKDevTool\". \u2460Find the path where the downloaded RKDevTool is located. \u2461Open the RKDevTool. \u2462The software will recognize a \"LOADER\" device. If it recognizes \"MASKROOM,\" it indicates there is no data in the eMMC, hence no erase operation is necessary. \u2463Click \"Advanced Function.\" \u2464Click \"EraseAll\" to begin erasing data from the eMMC. \u2465\"Erasing sectors success\" indicates the erasure is complete. Erasing eMMC After Booting from MicroSD Card \u00b6 1\u3001Refer to the steps in \"4.3.2 Writing System onto eMMC Using a MicroSD Card\" and log into the system terminal. 2\u3001Run the command sudo mkfs /dev/mmcblk1 and then enter \"y\" to confirm. System Configuration \u00b6 Using Ethernet \u00b6 Ethernet is plug-and-play and requires no additional setup. Setting Up WiFi \u00b6 After the system image has been written, the MicroSD card will have a FAT32 partition recognized by the computer. In this partition, there is a \"system.cfg\" file. Open it and replace \"Your SSID\" with your actual WiFi name and \"Your Password\" with the actual password. Configuring Overlays \u00b6 Open the \"armbianEnv.txt\" file in the BOOT partition and set the values for overlays. The configuration file supports only one line of overlays at a time; if multiple overlays are enabled, only the last line will take effect. If you need multiple overlays, place the contents of multiple configurations on the same line separated by a space. For example, if you need to use a DSI screen, MCP2515 SPI to CAN module, and I2C1 simultaneously: overlays=dsi mcp2515 i2c1 Configuring the Display \u00b6 1\u3001Open the \"armbianEnv.txt\" file in the BOOT partition. 2\u3001The default overlay is set to \"hdmi,\" meaning the system uses an HDMI screen by default. This can be changed to match the actual screen being used, such as: \u00b7 \"hdmi\": HDMI screen \u00b7 \"dsi\": DSI screen \u00b7 \"tft_35\": SPI Screen \u00b7 For \"tft_35\", there is also a \"tft35_spi_rotate\" parameter for system-level screen rotation, with default \"0\" meaning no rotation, other options include \"90\", \"180\", \"270\". Note: Only one screen type can be used at a time. 3\u3001To configure KlipperScreen, open the system.cfg file in the BOOT partition. Set the screen type with the parameter ks_src , and the rotation angle with ks_angle . Using SPI to CAN \u00b6 Open the \"armbianEnv.txt\" file in the BOOT partition and add \"mcp2515\" to the overlays configuration. Using CSI Camera and Crowsnest Configuration \u00b6 For both RPi v1.3 ov5647 and RPi v2 imx219 cameras, no specific configuration in \"armbianEnv.txt\" is required as they are plug-and-play. \"crowsnest.conf\" file configuration is as follows: device: /dev/video0 # The CSI camera node is fixed as video0 custom_flags: --format=UYVY # The current system's CSI camera does not support the default YUYV, so it needs to be set to the supported UYVY format. Using Bluetooth \u00b6 1\u3001To scan for Bluetooth devices, enter the following command, and a list of Bluetooth devices will appear as shown below: bluetoothctl --timeout 15 scan on 2\u3001Find your Bluetooth device, for example, if your device name is \"HONOR xSport PRO\", locate the corresponding Bluetooth MAC ID as shown below. 3\u3001To connect to a Bluetooth device, enter the following command, connection success is shown as below bluetoothctl connect E0:9D:FA:50:CD:4F \u2460If there's an issue while connecting, as shown below, please restart the Bluetooth device and repeat steps 1 and 2 to connect. \u2461If there's an issue while connecting, as shown below, please enter the following commands and then repeat steps 1 and 2: bluetoothctl remove E0:9D:FA:50:CD:4F (Your Bluetooth device's corresponding MAC ID) rfkill block bluetooth sleep 3s rfkill unblock bluetooth pulseaudio -k pulseaudio \u2013start 4\u3001 If you exit voice playback during the use of Bluetooth and cannot reuse it, manually delete the corresponding playback process. Use the ps command to view the process number, then use kill -9 process_number to delete the corresponding playback process. Setting up 3.5mm Headphones Port \u00b6 1\u3001Enter the command: aplay -l Check for the corresponding sound card, as shown in the image (the sound card for the headphone port shown in the image corresponds to card 0 ). 2\u3001Enter the command: amixer -c 0 contents (0 represents the card 0 found in the previous aplay -l command) Check the settings for playback and recording channels, as shown in the image. 3\u3001Enter the command: amixer -c 0 cset numid=1 3 Set the playback channel, as shown in the image. 4\u3001Enter the command: amixer -c 0 cset numid=2 1 Set the recording channel, as shown in the image. 5\u3001Enter the following command to play audio, with the audio file directory xxx and the audio file name xxxxx.wav: aplay -D plughw:0,0 /xxx/xxxxx.wav 6\u3001Enter the following command to record (where 10 represents recording for 10 seconds), storing the recording in directory xxx, file name xxxx.wav: sudo arecord -Dhw:0,0 -d 10 -f cd -r 44100 -c 2 -t wav /xxx/xxxx.wav 7\u3001Enter the following command to play the recording: aplay -D plughw:0,0 /xxx/xxxx.wav SSH Connect to Device \u00b6 1\u3001Install the SSH software Mobaxterm: https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html 2\u3001After powering on, wait for the system to boot, which typically takes about 1 to 2 minutes. 3\u3001Once the device is connected to WiFi or an Ethernet cable is plugged in, it will automatically be assigned an IP address. 4\u3001Access the router management interface to find the device's IP (it should be BTT-CB2 here). 5\u3001Open Mobaxterm and click \"Session\", and click \"SSH\", inset the device IP into Remote host and click \"OK\" (Note: your computer and the device needs to be in the same network). 6\u3001Login as: biqu password: biqu Precautions \u00b6 1\u3001About 10 seconds after powering on, the system enters the kernel phase. At this time, the blue light stays on, and the green light flashes continuously, indicating that the system is running normally. 2\u3001Root administrator: \u200b Login: root \u200b Password: root \u200b BIQU user: \u200b Login: biqu \u200b Password: biqu 3\u3001The PCIe M.2 interface does not support hot-plugging; the solid-state drive must be connected in advance for the device to be recognized. 4\u3001When booting from eMMC, do not insert a MicroSD card.

When using CAN communication, you need to see whether it is used as a terminal. If it is, you must plug a jumper cap on the 120R position. When DIY crimping, wire according to the silkscreen, and DIY according to the Pin and Schematic diagrams so as to avoid the power line from being reversely connected or connected to the CAN signal, which will get the module burned. If there's no external power supply during programming via USB port, you need to short the VUSB by jumper cap so as to supply the module with working voltage. The load current of the heater cartridge and the fan interfaces shall not exceed the maximum withstand current to prevent the MOS tube from being burned out. Please pay attention to the precautions in 4.2 Firmware Update to avoid keeping MCU in DFU mode for a long time when the main power supply and hotend are connected. FAQ \u00b6 Q: What's the maximum current for the heater cartridge and fan interface? A: The maximum output current of the heater cartridge interface: 5A. The maximum output current of the fan interface: 1A. The total current for the heater cartridge, driver and fan needs to be less than 9A. Q: Cannot update firmware via USB port?

Update Firmware via Computer \u00b6 1\u3001Press and hold the Boot button, then connect Eddy to your computer's USB port using a USB cable. 2\u3001Once recognized as a storage device, copy the downloaded klipper.uf2 to it. Eddy will automatically update its firmware and restart. The update is complete after the restart. Update Firmware via DFU \u00b6 1\u3001Press and hold the Boot button, then connect Eddy to the USB port of your Raspberry Pi/BIGTREETECH Pi using a USB cable. 2\u3001In the SSH terminal, run the command lsusb to query the DFU device ID. 3\u3001Run: cd ~/klipper make flash FLASH_DEVICE=2e8a:0003 to start writing the firmware (Note: Replace 2e8a:0003 with the actual ID of the device obtained in the previous step). 4\u3001Once firmware writing is complete, run the following to query the ID for USB communication: ls /dev/serial/by-id/ This ID can also be located in Mainsail.

This coordinate is relative to the Eddy's location. This will be the first scanning point, closest to the origin. This parameter must be provided for rectangular beds. mesh_max: 220, 220 # For rectangular beds, defines the maximum X, Y coordinates of the grid. Following the same principle as mesh_min, but this will be the scanning point farthest from the bed origin. This parameter must be provided for rectangular beds. probe_count: 5, 5 # For rectangular beds, this is a pair of comma-separated integers X, Y, defining the number of points probed along each axis. A single value is also valid, in which case the value will be applied to both axes. Refer to https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_Reference.html#bed_mesh The parameter horizontal_move_z in [bed_mesh] should be set to 2 to bring Eddy as close to the bed as possible during scanning. Calibration \u00b6 1\u3001After the above configuration is completed, first calibrate the drive current of Eddy. Position Eddy about 20mm above the platform. Execute in Mainsail's Console: LDC_CALIBRATE_DRIVE_CURRENT CHIP=btt_eddy Save the settings with \u2018SAVE_CONFIG\u2019. 2\u3001Calibrate the relationship between Eddy frequency and Z-axis height. First, home the X and Y axes: G28 X Y Center the nozzle: (ensure there is no height map activated during this step). G0 X150 Y150 F6000 Perform manual z-offset calibration Paper test : PROBE_EDDY_CURRENT_CALIBRATE CHIP=btt_eddy Save the settings with \u2018SAVE_CONFIG\u2019. 3\u3001For printers with z_tilt or quad_gantry_level (QGL) function, run Z_TILT_ADJUST or QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL once to prevent the nozzle from hitting the heated bed during grid scanning. 4\u3001At this point, you can home all axes, then execute the following command for rapid grid scanning: BED_MESH_CALIBRATE METHOD=scan SCAN_MODE=rapid Save the settings with \u2018SAVE_CONFIG\u2019. 5\u3001Temperature Compensation (The coil version has no temperature compensation, ignore this step): Note: Exercise caution as the heated bed can reach very high temperatures. (1) Home all axes. (2) Set the machine's idle timeout longer to prevent a timeout during the heating process: \u200b SET_IDLE_TIMEOUT TIMEOUT=36000 (3) Record Temperatures: \u200b Document the BIGTREETECH Eddy temperature at room temperature. Set the heated bed to its maximum temperature and a commonly used tool head temperature. Wait for the BIGTREETECH Eddy temperature to stabilize and then record the highest temperature reached, which will serve as the target temperature for the next steps. Ensure this target is slightly below the maximum to prevent overheating. (4) Wait until it returns to room temperature and then execute: \u200b PROBE_DRIFT_CALIBRATE PROBE=btt_eddy TARGET=50 STEP=5 \u200b Where TARGET=50 means the target temperature is 50\u2103, and STEP=5 means each node's temperature scale is 5\u2103. \u200b For example, if the current temperature is 30\u2103 and the target temperature is 50\u2103, then the total temperature range is 50-30=20\u2103, and the temperature scale for each node is 5\u2103, so there will be 20 / 5 = 4 nodes sampled. \u200b Executing the above command will immediately require a manual z-offset calibration ( Paper test ). Then manually heat the heated bed and nozzle, waiting for the BIGTREETECH Eddy temperature to rise. The BIGTREETECH Eddy will require another manual z-offset calibration ( Paper test ) at the next node, which is 35\u2103, and then another manual z-offset calibration ( Paper test ) at the next node, which is 40\u2103, and so on.","title":"Eddy"},{"location":"Eddy.html#eddy","text":"Product Link: https://biqu.equipment/products/bigtreetech-eddy Eddy Guide Video","title":"Eddy"},{"location":"Eddy.html#features-highlights","text":"Compact size and lightweight; Equipped with temperature compensation; Highly efficient leveling; Broad application, strong compatibility; High precision, strong stability; Non-contact operation.","title":"Features Highlights"},{"location":"Eddy.html#specifications","text":"Name Eddy Weight 6g Voltage 5V Static Current 30mA Operating Current 30mA Cable Length 2.5 m (USB Version), 15 cm (Coil Version) Connection USB: 4-pin, 1.5mm pitch Coil: 4-2.54mm DuPont female header, one end with ZH1 5mm 4P connector Operating Temperature \u226460\u2103 Ambient Standard Error 0.5\u03bcm Compatible Models All FDM printers using the Klipper firmware","title":"Specifications"},{"location":"Eddy.html#dimensions","text":"Note: When installing Eddy, ensure the bottom is at least 1-2 mm above the nozzle.

(1) Home all axes. (2) Set the machine's idle timeout longer to prevent a timeout during the heating process: \u200b SET_IDLE_TIMEOUT TIMEOUT=36000 (3) Record Temperatures: \u200b Document the BIGTREETECH Eddy temperature at room temperature. Set the heated bed to its maximum temperature and a commonly used tool head temperature. Wait for the BIGTREETECH Eddy temperature to stabilize and then record the highest temperature reached, which will serve as the target temperature for the next steps. Ensure this target is slightly below the maximum to prevent overheating. (4) Wait until it returns to room temperature and then execute: \u200b PROBE_DRIFT_CALIBRATE PROBE=btt_eddy TARGET=50 STEP=5 \u200b Where TARGET=50 means the target temperature is 50\u2103, and STEP=5 means each node's temperature scale is 5\u2103. \u200b For example, if the current temperature is 30\u2103 and the target temperature is 50\u2103, then the total temperature range is 50-30=20\u2103, and the temperature scale for each node is 5\u2103, so there will be 20 / 5 = 4 nodes sampled. \u200b Executing the above command will immediately require a manual z-offset calibration ( Paper test ). Then manually heat the heated bed and nozzle, waiting for the BIGTREETECH Eddy temperature to rise. The BIGTREETECH Eddy will require another manual z-offset calibration ( Paper test ) at the next node, which is 35\u2103, and then another manual z-offset calibration ( Paper test ) at the next node, which is 40\u2103, and so on.","title":"Calibration"},{"location":"Extruders.html","text":"Extruders \u00b6","title":"Extruders"},{"location":"Extruders.html#extruders","text":"","title":"Extruders"},{"location":"H2%20V2S%20Lite%20Revo.html","text":"H2 V2S Lite Revo \u00b6","title":"H2 V2S Lite Revo"},{"location":"H2%20V2S%20Lite%20Revo.html#h2-v2s-lite-revo","text":"","title":"H2 V2S Lite Revo"},{"location":"H2%20V2S%20Lite.html","text":"H2 V2S Lite \u00b6","title":"H2 V2S Lite"},{"location":"H2%20V2S%20Lite.html#h2-v2s-lite","text":"","title":"H2 V2S Lite"},{"location":"H2%20V2S%20Revo.html","text":"H2 V2S Revo \u00b6","title":"H2 V2S Revo"},{"location":"H2%20V2S%20Revo.html#h2-v2s-revo","text":"","title":"H2 V2S Revo"},{"location":"H2%20V2S.html","text":"H2 V2S \u00b6","title":"H2 V2S"},{"location":"H2%20V2S.html#h2-v2s","text":"","title":"H2 V2S"},{"location":"H2%20V2X.html","text":"H2 V2X \u00b6 Product Link: https://biqu.equipment/products/h2-v2x Github Link: https://github.com/bigtreetech/H2-V2X Introduction \u00b6 The H2 V2X is an ultra-lightweight (145g) direct drive extruder designed for highend CoreXY printers, Precision CNC machined from AL6061 T6 aluminum.

As shown in the image below, the UUID of the device is found. 2\u3001Enter python3 flash_can.py -i can0 -f ~/klipper/out/klipper.bin -u be69315a613c replacing the UUID parameter after \"-u\" with the actual UUID on your board. Note: by this point, you should have already compiled klipper.bin using \"make\". Additionally, when selecting the bootloader offset in the Klipper menuconfig, use the 16KiB option since Katapult's Application start offset is 16KiB. The image below shows a successful flashing sequence. 3\u3001Re-enter python3 flash_can.py -i can0 -q to query. At this stage, the \u2018Application\u2019 has changed from Katapult to Klipper, indicating that Klipper is running normally. Firmware Update via DFU \u00b6 Raspberry Pi or CB1 firmware update through DFU: 1\u3001Hold down the Boot button and connect to Raspberry Pi/CB1 with a Type-C cable. This allows the chip to enter DFU mode. 2\u3001In the SSH terminal command line, enter lsusb to query the DFU device ID. 3\u3001Enter cd klipper to navigate to the klipper directory, then enter make flash FLASH_DEVICE=2e8a:0003 to start flashing the firmware (note: replace 2e8a:0003 with the actual device ID obtained in the previous step). 4\u3001After flashing, enter ls/dev/serial/by-id/ to query the device Serial ID (this ID is only available for USB communication, this step can be ignored when using CAN bus communication). 5\u3001If using USB communication, there is no need to manually press the Boot button to enter DFU mode for subsequent updates after the first flashing is completed. Directly enter make flash FLASH_DEVICE=/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Klipper_rp2040_4550357128922FC8-if00 to flash the firmware (note: replace /dev/serial/by-id/xxx with the actual ID obtained in the previous step). 6\u3001If using CAN bus communication, unplug the Type-C data cable after flashing. CAN Bus Configuration \u00b6 For use with BIGTREETECH U2C module: 1\u3001In the SSH terminal, enter sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces.d/can0 and add the following content: allow-hotplug can0 iface can0 can static bitrate 1000000 up ifconfig $IFACE txqueuelen 1024 Set the CAN bus speed to 1M (speed must match the speed set in the firmware (1000000) CAN bus speed). Save the changes (Ctrl + S) and exit (Ctrl + X), then enter sudo reboot to restart Raspberry Pi. 2\u3001Each device on the CAN bus will generate a canbus_uuid based on the MCU's UID. To find each microcontroller device ID, ensure the hardware is powered on and properly wired, then run: ~/klippy-env/bin/python ~/klipper/scripts/canbus_query.py can0 3\u3001If an uninitialized CAN device is detected, the above command will report the device's canbus_uuid: Found canbus_uuid=0e0d81e4210c 4\u3001If Klipper is already running and connected to this device, the canbus_uuid will not be reported. Configuring Klipper \u00b6 1\u3001Access the mainsail web UI by entering the IP address of the BTT Pi or Raspberry Pi into the browser. Using the path shown in the image below, download the reference configuration named sample-bigtreetech-hermit-crab-2-canbus.cfg. If this file is not found, update the Klipper firmware source code to the latest version or use the link to download it from GitHub: https://github.com/bigtreetech/HermitCrab 2\u3001Upload the motherboard configuration file to Configuration Files. 3\u3001Add the Hermit Crab configuration to the printer.cfg file: [include sample-bigtreetech-hermit-crab-2-canbus.cfg] 4\u3001Change the USB serial or CAN UUID within the configuration file to match the actual ID of the motherboard (USB serial or canbus). 5\u3001Configure the specific functions of the module according to the instructions in the following link: https://www.klipper3d.org/Overview.html Precautions \u00b6 1\u3001When using CAN communication, check if this is used as a terminating device (one of the two devices at either end of the bus). If it is, ensure that the 120R position has a jumper inserted. 2\u3001 When wiring, pay attention to the wire sequence and follow the Pin diagram for DIY instructions to avoid reversing the power line or connecting it to the CAN signal since this could cause damage to the Hermit Crab. 3\u3001When flashing the firmware through the USB port without an external power supply, short the VUSB with a jumper to provide working voltage to the module. 4\u3001The load current of the heater cartridge and fan interface should not be greater than the maximum rated current to prevent burning out the MOS tube. FAQ \u00b6 Q: Maximum current for heater cartridge and fan ports. A: Maximum output current for heater cartridge port: 6 A. Fan interface maximum output current: 1A, peak 1.5A.

We have customized installation print parts for KNOMI 2, facilitating its easy installation into your Voron StealthBurner. In particular, our StealthBurner Main Body not only retains the original fan positions but also incorporates a circular ventilation opening at the top, enhancing compatibility and optimizing heat dissipation. DOWNLOAD THE PRINTED PARTS https://github.com/bigtreetech/KNOMI MOUNTING PLATE Before you start the assembly, we recommend preparing these two printed parts in advance. The Mounting Plate is designed with a snap-on feature due to size limitations and considerations for the air duct design. This may cause some wear and tear through repeated disassembling and reassembling. Hence, we suggest printing several extra copies of this part for future use. We conducted a comparative analysis measuring wind speed and acoustic energy levels between the original StealthBurner and our customized version featuring vents and KNOMI 2 add-on. The results showed that both versions performed similarly, indicating that adding KNOMI 2 will not compromise the performance of the StealthBurner.

Power Loss Recovery \u00b6 There are two methods for power loss recovery 1\u3001No extra module needed, the motherboard will write current print status to the SD card after every layer is printed, which shortens the life of the SD card severely. #define POWER_LOSS_RECOVERY // enable power loss recovery #define PLR_ENABLED_DEFAULT true // true default to power loss recovery enabled 2\u3001External UPS 24V V1.0 module, when power is cut, the module will provide power to the board and signal the board to save current print status to SD card. This method has virtually no effect on the life of the SD card. #define POWER_LOSS_RECOVERY // enable power loss recovery #define PLR_ENABLED_DEFAULT true // true default to power loss recovery enabled #define POWER_LOSS_ZRAISE 10 // raise the print head by 10mm after power loss to prevent the nozzle from touching the printed part #define POWER_LOSS_STATE HIGH // set signal level, UPS 24V V1.0 returns low level when not triggered and HIGH level when power is cut, thus this setting needs to be HIGH RGB \u00b6 #define NEOPIXEL_LED // enable Neopixel #define NEOPIXEL_TYPE NEO_GRB // set Neopixel type //#define NEOPIXEL_PIN 4 // disable PIN setting, use the correct signal pin in the pin file of the motherboard #define NEOPIXEL_PIXELS 30 // number of LEDs #define NEOPIXEL_STARTUP_TEST // the light will show red green and blue sequentially to self-test If you are using displays like LCD2004, 12864, mini12864, etc., you can also control RGB from your display directly. #define LED_CONTROL_MENU // add led control to your menu. Filament Sensor \u00b6 Standard filament run out sensors are usually comprised of a microswitch which signals the mainboard of filament status with High or Low level signal. #define FILAMENT_RUNOUT_SENSOR // enable filament run out sensor #define FIL_RUNOUT_ENABLED_DEFAULT true // true default to filament run out sensor enabled #define NUM_RUNOUT_SENSORS 1 // number of filament run out sensor #define FIL_RUNOUT_STATE LOW // voltage level of the filament runout sensor trigger signal. Set according to the actual situation of the module. If the module sends a low level when the filament is abnormal, set it to LOW. Smart Filament Sensor (SFS V1.0) \u00b6 The smart filament sensor works by continuously sending signal to the mainboard to communicate filament status. #define FILAMENT_MOTION_SENSOR // set encoder type #define FILAMENT_RUNOUT_DISTANCE_MM 7 // set sensitivity, SFS V1.0 nominal setting should be 7mm, which means if no signal of filament movement is detected after 7mm of filament travel command, filament error will be triggered. The settings below also need to be set to instruct the printer to park the nozzle after filament error is detected. #define NOZZLE_PARK_FEATURE // park nozzle #define NOZZLE_PARK_POINT { (X_MIN_POS + 10), (Y_MAX_POS - 10), 20 } // set the X, Y and Z offset coordinate of the nozzle #define ADVANCED_PAUSE_FEATURE // retraction setting of nozzle park movement and filament purge distance after the print is resumed.

Interfaces with a Raspberry Pi using emulated serial over USB or direct UART to any of the serial ports on the board. Interfaces with a Raspberry Pi using emulated serial over USB or direct UART to any of the serial ports on the board. Supports up to 4 hotend heaters. Provides separate power inputs for motors, bed heating and logic/fans/hotends. Supports 12V or 24V supply inputs (12V only supported on motor and bed. Logic must be > 14.1V and < 28V) with built in 12V (4A), 5V (8A) and 3.3V (1A) regulators to provide rails for peripheral use. Up to 6 PWM fans and 2 always-on fans with the ability to individually select the voltage rail that will drive each fan. Select from Vin, 12V or 5V. Flyback protection on PWM fan ports \u2013 Many people find that their fan ports become damaged after some time when using larger fans. This is because of the inductance in the fan coils. The octopus includes flyback protection on each fan port which will protect the FETs from damage caused by turning the fans on and off. Includes USB-C interface which supports an emulated serial port that allows printing via USB. Supports all versions of BIGTREETECH TFT screens and LCD12864 screens. Supports multiple languages such as English and Simplified Chinese and can easily switch between different languages (when using the BTT TFT). Includes a bootloader that allows firmware upgrades via the SD card. This offers a simple, efficient, and convenient way to update the firmware. Uses high-performance MOSFETs to increase heating efficiency while also reducing heat generation on the motherboard. Uses easily replaceable fuses Supports \u201cprint from SD card\u201d and \u201cprint via USB OTG\u201d using the integrated USB-A port. Provides two stepper outputs, connected in parallel, to the Z driver allowing for a parallel, dual Z axis drive. Supports firmware update via DFU mode.

Supports BL Touch and various other ABL sensors. Provides a dedicated \u201cPROBE\u201d port for bed probes. This port is internally protected via an optocoupler which means that you don\u2019t need to use a BAT85 diode.Additionaly, the octopus-pro includes a pull up resistor on the probe port which can be selected or deactivated using a jumper. This allows it to work with both NPN and PNP type probes. Supports CAN BUS using a 6P6C RJ11 interface, which offers the board the ability to interface with future expansion modules. Supports StallGuard for sensorless homing with TMC drivers Provides an SPI expansion port which can connect the SPI-based expansion modules. Supports the shutdown after printing function.

For better viewability please consult the PINS.pdf document. Hardware Configuration \u00b6 Note: The octopus-pro packs a ton of features which necessitates many components and connectors. Given the component and connector density it was not possible to include the silk screen for connector labels on the top. We recommend that you snap a picture of the bottom of the board before starting the installation so that you have a label reference on hand. If you forget to do so then you can always make use of the PINS.pdf file available on our github repo . POWER WIRING \u00b6 The octopus pro provides three separate power inputs: motherboard power, motor power, and bed heater power. This allows a user to use several power supplies with common grounds in order to ensure that they are able to provide the required power to each part of their system. The motherboard power is regulated using a number of switch-mode and low dropout power supplies to provide the supply rails of 12V, 5V and 3.3V. The 12V, 5V and 3.3V rails are made available via various pins on the motherboard. Consult the PINS.pdf document to find a breakout header if you plan to use one of these supply rails. Take note that the 12V rail can supply up to 4A, the 5V up to 8A and the 3.3V up to 1A however, in order to prevent overloading the rails it is not recommended to load them to their maximum capacity since there are already various components on the motherboard which also take their supply from them. Power wiring is as shown below (look on the underside of your board to quickly identify the purpose of each input if the pins file is not on hand). The positive (red) wire from the power supply goes to the terminal marked +. The negative (black) wire from the power supply goes to the terminal marked -. The polarity (+ and -) is also silk screened onto the underside of the board. Note: DO NOT alter the board wiring with the power on and be sure to get the polarity correct otherwise you can damage the motherboard. MCU POWER JUMPER \u00b6 The Octopus can be powered using the USB-C port by inserting the jumper as shown below. This can make it easier to compile and download firmware directly to the motherboard using DFU mode. If you do not connect this jumper then you must provide the board with power via the main input supply if you would like to communicate via USB-C. Hardware Installation \u00b6 AUTOMATIC POWER DOWN WIRING \u00b6 When using the BIGTREETECH Relay V1.2 module, the wiring can be performed as shown in the figure below. Note: Since power will still be supplied to the Relay 1.2 module after it has cut power to the motherboard, it is extremely dangerous to touch the it while the printer is still connected to mains. Always remove all mains power when working on this wiring. BL TOUCH WIRING \u00b6 When using a BL Touch, wire it to the motherboard as shown in the figure below. As always, never perform any work on the motherboard with power applied. POWER LOSS RECOVERY MODULE WIRING \u00b6 When using the BIGTREETECH mini UPS, wire it to the motherboard as shown in the figure below. As always, never perform any work on the motherboard with power applied. RGB LED WIRING \u00b6 When using the motherboard with RGB LEDs you should wire them as shown in the image below. The exact pinout of the connector can be found on the silkscreen on the underside of the motherboard. RASPBERRY PI WIRING \u00b6 The motherboard supports a connection to a Raspberry Pi for printing. There are several connection options available to connect to a raspberry pi. Simplest of all is to connect the raspberry pi directly to the USB-C port which will emulate a virtual serial port on the pi. However, if you have another need for the USB-C port you are still able to connect the raspberry pi to the motherboard using a direct serial connection over UART or SPI. Dedicated UART and SPI pin headers have been made available on the motherboard for this purpose with the pin mappings conveniently printed in silkscreen on the underside of the board for each. It is beyond the scope of this manual to detail exactly how to connect the raspberry pi to either of these headers however there is an abundance of material online that explains how to interface a raspberry pi to an external device over either of these serial busses. 5V power for the raspberry pi is provided via the dedicated Raspberry pi header (UART2). Consult the PINS.pdf document for the exact pinout of this header. PROBE PORT WIRING \u00b6 The probe port has been provided to allow users to interface bed probes directly to the motherboard without the need for a BAT85 diode to act as a protection against high voltages. The probe signal pin connects to an internal optocoupler that in turn triggers the pin connected to the microcontroller. Depending on the type of probe you are using, you may need to add a jumper to activate the internal 12k pull up resistor between the probe positive voltage rail and the probe signal pin. This will be the case if you are using an \u201cNPN\u201d style probe where the output pulls to ground when it is active. You can tell this by checking the output of your probe using a multimeter. If it floats when it is not active (with nothing else connected to it) and then goes to ground when it is active, it is an NPN style probe. If it goes to the positive rail when active then it is a PNP style probe. The image below shows where the jumper to activate the 12k pull up resistor is located. Regardless of the kind of probe you are using, you will need to enable the internal pulldown resistor on the probe input pin in order for it to generate an output signal. Please refer to the pin configuration instructions for the specific firmware that you are using to find out how to enable a pull down resistor on the probe input pin (PC5). Refer to Section 4.2 for further information on how to configure the voltage used by the probe port. STEPPER DRIVER OPERATIONAL MODES \u00b6 STEP/DIR MODE \u00b6 If you are using drivers that do not support configuration over a serial port then you will need to operate them in step/dir mode and set the jumpers beneath the stepper driver according to the microstepping you desire. Each driver will have its own microstepping table so we do not attempt to speak on behalf of the driver manufacturer in our manual. Please consult the datasheet of your driver to determine what signals need to be applied to the microstepping configuration pins in order to achieve the microstepping you desire. Nevertheless, below you will see a figure which will help you to identify which jumpers correspond to the pins that your drivers will use to configure microstepping and we have additionally included a section in appendix A1 which contains the microstepping tables for some of the most common drivers. This should be viewed as a convenience to the user and we still recommend that you consult the datasheet of your driver manufacturer. In the above image the red rectangle isolates the groups of driver pins. For the purpose of running the drivers in step/dir mode the pinout can be described as per the table below. Note that this is not the actual pinout but rather a simplification for step/dir mode. Connecting jumpers between the lower two rows will set the middle pin (MS) to 5V except for the jumpers in the first column where it will connect SLP and RST. Note that if your stepper driver requires 0V to be present on any of the pins then there is actually no need to connect a jumper to that pin when running in step/dir mode and connecting a jumper in this instance could cause interference since those lines are used for the SPI bus. Note that if you use an A4988 or a DRV8825 driver, you must connect RST and SLP. For details, please click: https://z1996xm.github.io/BIGTREETECH/Tutorials.html UART MODE \u00b6 When using a driver in UART mode, connect the jumpers beneath that driver as show in the image below. SPI MODE \u00b6 When using a driver in SPI mode, connect the jumpers beneath that driver as shown in the image below. MOTHERBOARD JUMPER SETTINGS \u00b6 MOTOR POWER SELECTION JUMPERS \u00b6 Each motor driver on the octopus pro can have the voltage used by it configured via a jumper. Note: Before powering your octopus pro, always double check the driver voltage jumpers to ensure that the correct voltage is being routed to each driver. Sending a high voltage to a driver that is not rated for it is likely to destroy it and may even cause damage to the motherboard. Setting the jumper for any given driver to the right, as shown in the image below, will provide the motherboard input voltage for that driver to use. Generally the motherboard uses 24V. Setting the jumper for any given driver to the left, as shown in the image below, will provide the motor input voltage for that driver to use. This can be up to 60V. Note: Never remove or insert a jumper when power is applied to either the board input or the motor input. FAN AND PROXIMITY SWITCH VOLTAGE SETTINGS \u00b6 The Octopus features 6 PWM fan outputs and two \u201calways on\u201d fan outputs. There is also a dedicated pin header for a proximity sensor or probe. All of the fan outputs and the proximity sensor input can individually have the voltage supplied by their pin header selected by configuring the jumpers associated with each header. Configure the jumpers as below to select 24V (note that all are shown in the same configuration even though they can be individually configured). Configure the jumpers as below to select 12V. Configure the jumpers as below for 5V. Note: Since the jumpers carry a voltage rail directly from one of the regulators or from the input, if you short the jumpers in any way other than the shown connections, you will likely cause damage to the motherboard. When connecting the fan, make sure that you connect the positive terminal to the positive output as shown in the images. STALLGUARD JUMPER SETTINGS \u00b6 The \u201cdiag\u201d jumpers which are used to connect the diagnostic output pin to the endstop inputs for drivers which support the stallguard feature (TMC2209/TMC2226, etc\u2026) can be found in the location shown in the image below. The exact diag numbering can be found by looking at the pins file or the silkscreen beneath the board. PT100/PT1000 DIP SWITCHES \u00b6 The PT100 amplifier supports 2,3 and 4 wire connections to the board. However, the DIP switch needs to be configured for the setup that you are using. You can find the DIP switch in the location shown in the image below. Note that the DIP switch has switch numbers and the \u201con\u201d position printed on it. Select the connection arrangement for your thermistor according to the table below. Bear in mind that you will still need to configure your firmware using the correct sense resistor values which will be 430\uf057 for the PT100 and 4300\uf057 for the PT1000. 1 2 3 4 Sensor model ON ON ON OFF Two-wire PT100 ON ON OFF ON Two-wire PT1000 OFF ON ON OFF Three-wire PT100 OFF ON OFF ON Three-wire PT1000 If you are using a three-wire arrangement, then you will also need to make a small adjustment to an SMD resistor on the board. The image below shows the factory default resistor setting in the blue box (2/4 wire arrangement). Using a 3 wire arrangement will require you to move the resistor from the blue box into the red box and then to leave the pads in the blue box unpopulated. These resistors are 0\uf057 so if you do not feel comfortable soldering them back in place you can always just create a solder bridge between the pads instead, selecting the pads appropriate to your arrangement. Software Installation \u00b6 COMMUNICATING WITH THE MOTHERBOARD \u00b6 After connecting the motherboard to a computer via a USB cable, the driver will be automatically installed (windows, linux and macos). Upon installation of the driver the motherboard should automatically enumerate as a virtual serial device which can be used for data transfer. If it fails to do so, you can visit our GitHub website: https://github.com/bigtreetech?tab=repositories and find the corresponding repository to download the driver. If you would like to confirm that the driver has been installed correctly you can access the device manager in windows and look for a virtual com port when the motherboard is plugged in. In the image below the motherboard has been assigned COM7 however your operating system may assign it any available COM port number. Other operating systems will list serial ports in a different manner. MOTHERBOARD FIRMWARE SUPPORT \u00b6 Marlin, Klipper and RRF (429 variant) all support the Octopus Pro. You can compile and configure you firmware variant of choice according to the methods specified by the developers of that firmware. In time, configuration files for different firmware distributions will be made available on the octopus-pro github . Covering how to compile firmware using VSCode is beyond the scope of this manual however there is an abundance of information online which explains how to set up VSCode on your machine and how to configure Marlin thereafter. Good places to start are provided for your convenience in the links below: \u2022 https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio_vscode.html \u2022 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq_ygvHF29I Once you have either compiled your own version of Marlin or downloaded a pre-compiled version, you can install it by following the steps below: Make sure that the firmware binary is named \u201cfirmware.bin\u201d. Any other name will be rejected by the bootloader. Use an SD card that has been formatted using the SD formatter tool here: https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/ Copy the firmware binary file to the SD card. Insert the SD card into the motherboard and reset it. Remove the SD card and check that the file has changed name to \u201cFIRMWARE.CUR\u201d. This will confirm that the firmware was successfully installed. If you are using Klipper then please ensure that you have the following settings enabled for the 446 variant. Take careful note of the crystal oscillator frequency which is 12MHz and differs from the 429 variant. The 429 variant of the board makes use of a different frequency crystal oscillator (8MHz) and therefore the klipper configuration needs to be adjusted slightly as show in in the image below. PRECAUTIONS \u00b6 The precautions listed in this section should not be overlooked. They have been included as reminders to prevent damage to your motherboard. Never work on the motherboard with power applied. Always double check all jumpers and wiring before applying power. Improper jumpers or wiring can cause damage to the motherboard and possibly even peripherals that it interfaces with. The motherboard can power heated beds up to 300W. If you are using a bed that operates at a higher power then you will need to use an external MOSFET. Do not connect a voltage source greater than 28V to this input. Never short circuit the 3.3V, 5V, 12V or 24V supplies to each other. Doing so will let out some smoke and BTT will not be able to put it back for you. You cannot power external devices using the USB-C interface. It is designed for data only. Always consult the PIN.pdf diagram when making jumper connections or wiring changes. Assuming a connection order may result in damage to the motherboard. It is recommended to update the firmware using SD card. Using DFU (direct programming via the USB port) will overwrite the bootloader meaning that you will no longer have the option to update via SD card unless you reflash the bootloader.

They have been included as reminders to prevent damage to your motherboard. Never work on the motherboard with power applied. Always double check all jumpers and wiring before applying power. Improper jumpers or wiring can cause damage to the motherboard and possibly even peripherals that it interfaces with. The motherboard can power heated beds up to 300W. If you are using a bed that operates at a higher power then you will need to use an external MOSFET. Do not connect a voltage source greater than 28V to this input. Never short circuit the 3.3V, 5V, 12V or 24V supplies to each other. Doing so will let out some smoke and BTT will not be able to put it back for you. You cannot power external devices using the USB-C interface. It is designed for data only. Always consult the PIN.pdf diagram when making jumper connections or wiring changes. Assuming a connection order may result in damage to the motherboard. It is recommended to update the firmware using SD card. Using DFU (direct programming via the USB port) will overwrite the bootloader meaning that you will no longer have the option to update via SD card unless you reflash the bootloader.","title":"PRECAUTIONS"},{"location":"Octopus%20Pro.html#product-purchase-link","text":"Purchase Link: https://biqu.equipment/products/bigtreetech-octopus-pro-v1-0-chip-f446 If you have any issues with the product, please submit a support ticket. https://biqu3d.com/pages/submit-a-ticket Navigation: BIQU Official Website\uff1a http://biqu3d.com BIGTREETECH Official Website\uff1a http://bigtree-tech.com Online Store\uff1a https://biqu.equipment BIGTREETECH Official Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/bigtreetech Discord: https://discord.gg/hhZsV7zk Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/BIGTREETECH/","title":"Product Purchase Link"},{"location":"Octopus.html","text":"Octopus \u00b6 Product Profile \u00b6 The BIGTREETECH Octopus V1.0 is a powerful and feature rich, 3D printer motherboard that supports up to 8 stepper drivers with 9 stepper driver outputs in total. It is designed and manufactured by the 3D printing team of Shenzhen BIQU Innovation Technology Co., Ltd.. Product Link: https://biqu.equipment/products/bigtreetech-octopus-v1-1 Features Highlights \u00b6 Uses a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 series STM32F446ZET6 main control chip with a core frequency of 180MHz. Supports running Klipper and Marlin. Interfaces with a Raspberry Pi using emulated serial over USB or direct UART to any of the serial ports on the board. Supports up to 4 hotend heaters. Provides separate power inputs for motors, bed heating and logic/fans/hotends. Supports 12V or 24V supply inputs (12V only supported on motor and bed. Logic must be > 14.1V) with built in 12V (4A), 5V (8A) and 3.3V (1A) regulators to provide rails for peripheral use. Up to 6 PWM fans and 2 always-on fans with the ability to individually select the voltage rail that will drive each fan. Select from Vin, 12V or 5V. Flyback protection on PWM fan ports \u2013 Many people find that their fan ports become damaged after some time when using larger fans. This is because of the inductance in the fan coils. The octopus includes flyback protection on each fan port which will protect the FETs from damage caused by turning the fans on and off. Includes USB-C interface which supports an emulated serial port that allows printing via USB. Supports all versions of BIGTREETECH TFT screens and LCD12864 screens. Supports multiple languages such as English and Simplified Chinese and can easily switch between different languages (when using the BTT TFT). Includes a bootloader that allows firmware upgrades via the SD card. This offers a simple, efficient, and convenient way to update the firmware. Uses high-performance MOSFETs to increase heating efficiency while also reducing heat generation on the motherboard. Uses easily replaceable fuses Supports \u201cprint from SD card\u201d and \u201cprint via USB OTG\u201d using the integrated USB-A port. Provides two stepper outputs, connected in parallel, to the Z driver allowing for a parallel, dual Z axis drive. Supports firmware update via DFU mode. This is where the firmware is sent to the board directly from the PC and does not require a bootloader however this method is not recommended for novice users as discussed later in this document. Includes an onboard, 32K EEPROM (AT24C32). Provides an RGB LED interface. Provides a WiFi interface for ESP8266 based modules. Provides a DIY PT100 interface. In order to enable the interface a user would need to purchase an INA826AIDR amplifier in the SPO 8 package separately and solder it in place on the board. The connector and passive circuitry are already provided. All that is required is the amplifier IC. Thermistor input protection. This allows you to short a thermistor input directly to a voltage source (not that this makes it a good habit to pick up) up to Vin without causing damage to the motherboard. Allows unused thermistor inputs to be used as general purpose inputs by providing an input pin for each that bypasses the protection circuit. Supports BL Touch and various other ABL sensors. Provides a dedicated \u201cPROBE\u201d port for bed probes. This port is internally protected via an optocoupler which means that you don\u2019t need to use a BAT85 diode. Supports CAN BUS using a 6P6C RJ11 interface, which offers the board the ability to interface with future expansion modules. Supports StallGuard for sensorless homing with TMC drivers Provides an SPI expansion port which can connect the SPI-based expansion modules such as MAX31865 module. Supports the shutdown after printing function. Supports the power loss print resume function Includes inputs for up to 6 endstop switches and 2 filament runout interfaces.

For better viewability please consult the PINS.pdf document. Hardware Configuration \u00b6 POWER WIRING \u00b6 The octopus provides three separate power inputs: motherboard power, motor power, and bed heater power. This allows a user to use several power supplies with common grounds in order to ensure that they are able to provide the required power to each part of their system. The motherboard power is regulated using a number of switch-mode and low dropout power supplies to provide the supply rails of 12V, 5V and 3.3V. The 12V, 5V and 3.3V rails are made available via various pins on the motherboard. Consult the PINS.pdf document to find a breakout header if you plan to use one of these supply rails. Take note that the 12V rail can supply up to 4A, the 5V up to 8A and the 3.3V up to 1A however, in order to prevent overloading the rails it is not recommended to load them to their maximum capacity since there are already various components on the motherboard which also take their supply from them. Power wiring is as shown below (look on the underside of your board to identify the purpose of each input). The positive (red) wire from the power supply goes to the terminal marked +. The negative (black) wire from the power supply goes to the terminal marked -. The polarity (+ and -) is also silk screened onto the underside of the board as a convenience to the user. Note: DO NOT alter the board wiring with the power on and be sure to get the polarity correct, otherwise you can cause damage to the motherboard. MCU POWER JUMPER \u00b6 The Octopus can be powered using the USB-C port by inserting the jumper as shown below. This can make it easier to compile and download firmware directly to the motherboard using DFU mode. If you do not connect this jumper then you must provide the board with power via the main input supply if you would like to communicate via USB-C Hardware Installation \u00b6 AUTOMATIC POWER DOWN WIRING \u00b6 When using the BIGTREETECH Relay V1.2 module, the wiring can be performed as shown in the figure below. Note: Since power will still be supplied to the Relay 1.2 module after it has cut power to the motherboard, it is extremely dangerous to touch the Relay 1.2 module while the printer is still connected to mains. Always remove all mains power when working on this wiring. BL TOUCH WIRING \u00b6 When using a BL Touch, wire it to the motherboard as shown in the figure below. As always, never perform any work on the motherboard with power applied. POWER LOSS RECOVERY MODULE WIRING \u00b6 When using the BIGTREETECH mini UPS, wire it to the motherboard as shown in the figure below. As always, never perform any work on the motherboard with power applied. RGB LED WIRING \u00b6 When using the motherboard with RGB LEDs you should wire them as shown in the image below. The exact pinout of the connector can be found on the silkscreen on the underside of the motherboard. RASPBERRY PI WIRING \u00b6 Note: The 3.3V and GND pins for the SPI3 port were erroneously swapped on the silkscreen on the underside of some early boards. To be sure of the exact pinout please reference the PIN.pdf document for the SPI3 port. The motherboard supports a connection to a Raspberry Pi for printing. There are several connection options available to connect to a raspberry pi. Simplest of all is to connect the raspberry pi directly to the USB-C port which will emulate a virtual serial port on the pi. However, if you have another need for the USB-C port you are still able to connect the raspberry pi to the motherboard using a direct serial connection over UART or SPI. Dedicated UART and SPI pin headers have been made available on the motherboard for this purpose with the pin mappings conveniently printed in silkscreen on the underside of the board for each. It is beyond the scope of this manual to detail exactly how to connect the raspberry pi to either of these headers however there is an abundance of material online that explains how to interface a raspberry pi to an external device over either of these serial busses. 5V power for the raspberry pi is provided via the dedicated Raspberry pi header. Consult the PINS.pdf document for the exact pinout of this header. PROBE PORT WIRING \u00b6 The probe port has been provided to allow users to interface bed probes directly to the motherboard without the need for a BAT85 diode to act as a protection against high voltages. The probe signal pin connects to an internal optocoupler that in turn triggers the pin connected to the microcontroller. Depending on the type of probe you are using, you may need to add an external 4k7 pull up resistor between the probe positive voltage rail and the probe signal pin in order to get a reading. This will be the case if you are using an \u201cNPN\u201d style probe where the output pulls to ground when it is active. You can tell this by checking the output of your probe using a multimeter. If it floats when it is not active (with nothing else connected to it) and then goes to ground when it is active, it is an NPN style probe. If it goes to the positive rail when active then it is a PNP style probe. The image below shows how to connect the external 4k7 resistor when using an NPN probe. Regardless of the kind of probe you are using, you will need to enable the internal pulldown resistor on the probe input pin in order for it to generate an output signal. Please refer to the pin configuration instructions for the specific firmware that you are using to find out how to enable a pull down resistor on the probe input pin. STEPPER DRIVER OPERATIONAL MODES \u00b6 Note: The octopus packs a ton of features which means there are many connectors and components. In order to keep the board size to a minimum we placed the stepper sockets close to each other. This means that drivers will have a snug fit. STEP/DIR MODE \u00b6 If you are using drivers that do not support configuration over a serial port then you will need to operate them in step/dir mode and set the jumpers beneath the stepper driver according to the microstepping you desire. Each driver will have its own microstepping table so we do not attempt to speak on behalf of the driver manufacturer in our guide. Please consult the datasheet of your driver to determine what signals need to be applied to the microstepping configuration pins in order to achieve the microstepping you desire. Nevertheless, below you will see a figure which will help you to identify which jumpers correspond to the pins that your drivers will use to configure microstepping and we have additionally included a section in appendix A1 which contains the microstepping tables for some of the most common drivers. This should be viewed as a convenience to the user and we still recommend that you consult the datasheet of your driver manufacturer. In the above image the red rectangle isolates one group of driver pins. For the purpose of running the drivers in step/dir mode the pinout can be described as per the table below (note that this is not the actual pinout but rather a simplification for step/dir mode). Connecting jumpers between the upper two rows will set the middle pin (MS) to 0V. Connecting jumpers between the lower two rows will set the middle pin (MS) to 3.3V except for the jumpers in the first column where it will connect SLP and RST. Note that if you are using drivers in step/dir mode that use a microstepping factor other than 16 then you cannot use any other drivers in SPI mode since the pins that are required to set the microstepping to anything other than 16 are also shared with SPI. Note that if you use an A4988 or a DRV8825 driver, you must connect RST and SLP. For details, please click: https://bigtreetech.github.io/docs/Tutorials.html UART MODE \u00b6 When using a driver in UART mode, connect the jumpers beneath that driver as show in the image below. SPI MODE \u00b6 When using a driver in SPI mode, connect the jumpers beneath that driver as shown in the image below. MOTHERBOARD JUMPER SETTINGS \u00b6 FAN AND PROXIMITY SWITCH SETTINGS \u00b6 The Octopus features 6 PWM fan outputs and two \u201calways on\u201d fan outputs. There is also a dedicated pin header for a proximity sensor. These headers are shown in the image below. Note: The polarity of the fan ports was erroneously swapped on the silkscreen on the underside of some early boards. To be sure of the correct polarity, please consult the PINS.pdf document or see the images below. All of the fan outputs and the proximity sensor input can individually have the voltage supplied by their pin header selected by configuring the jumpers associated with each header. Configure the jumpers as below to select 12V. Configure the jumpers as below for 5V. Note: Since the jumpers carry a voltage rail directly from one of the regulators or from the input, if you short the jumpers in any way other than the shown connections, you will likely cause damage to the motherboard. When connecting the fan, make sure that you connect the positive terminal to the positive output as shown in the images. STALLGUARD JUMPER SETTINGS \u00b6 The \u201cdiag\u201d jumpers which are used to connect the diagnostic output pin to the endstop inputs for drivers which support the stallguard feature (TMC2209/TMC2226) can be found in the location shown in the image below. The exact diag numbering can be found by looking at the pins file or the silkscreen beneath the board. SPECIAL NOTE ON EXPANSION INTERFACES \u00b6 Expansion interfaces are provided for SPI, UART and I2C. In the very first production run of the Octopus the silkscreen on the underside of the PCB had two pins that were mislabeled on the SPI3 interface and two on the Raspberry Pi UART interface. To be sure that you are connecting your peripheral correctly, please refer to the PINS.pdf document if using the SPI or UART interface. Software Installation \u00b6 COMMUNICATING WITH THE MOTHERBOARD \u00b6 After connecting the motherboard to a computer via a USB cable, the driver will be automatically installed (windows, linux and macos). Upon installation of the driver the motherboard should automatically enumerate as a virtual serial device which can be used for data transfer. If it fails to do so, you can visit our GitHub website: https://github.com/bigtreetech?tab=repositories and find the corresponding repository to download the driver. If you would like to confirm that the driver has been installed correctly you can access the device manager in windows and look for a virtual com port when the motherboard is plugged in. In the image below the motherboard has been assigned COM7 however your operating system may assign it any available COM port number. Other operating systems will list serial ports in a different manner. MOTHERBOARD FIRMWARE SUPPORT \u00b6 You can find a pre-compiled version of Marlin for the Octopus by visiting https://github.com/bigtreetech?tab=repositories and looking for the Octopus repository. Alternately you can compile your own version using VScode. Covering how to compile firmware using VSCode is beyond the scope of this manual however there is an abundance of information online which explains how to set up VSCode on your machine and how to configure Marlin thereafter. Good places to start are provided for your convenience in the links below: \u2022 https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio_vscode.html \u2022 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq_ygvHF29I Once you have either compiled your own version of Marlin or downloaded a pre-compiled version, you can install it by following the steps below: Make sure that the firmware binary is named \u201cfirmware.bin\u201d. Any other name will be rejected by the bootloader. **Use an SD card that has been formatted using the SD formatter tool here: https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/** Copy the firmware binary file to the SD card. Insert the SD card into the motherboard and reset it. Remove the SD card and check that the file has changed name to \u201cFIRMWARE.CUR\u201d. This will confirm that the firmware was successfully installed. If you are using Klipper then please ensure that you have the following settings enabled in order to download the firmware to the board while preserving the factory bootloader: PRECAUTIONS \u00b6 The precautions listed in this section should not be overlooked. They have been included as reminders to prevent damage to your motherboard. Never work on the motherboard with power applied. Always double check all jumpers and wiring before applying power. Improper jumpers or wiring can cause damage to the motherboard and possibly even peripherals that it interfaces with. The motherboard can power heated beds up to 300W. If you are using a bed that operates at a higher power then you will need to use an external MOSFET. Always consult the PIN.pdf diagram when making jumper connections or wiring changes. Assuming a connection order may result in damage to the motherboard. It is recommended to update the firmware using SD card. Using DFU (direct programming via the USB port) will overwrite the bootloader meaning that you will no longer have the option to update via SD card. The stock Octopus does not come with a INA826AIDR amplifier chip. If you want to use the PT100 interface, you need to purchase a INA826AIDR chip (SOP-8 Package) separately and solder the chip into the correct position as shown below. The silkscreen on the first production run of the octopus had incorrectly labeled pins on the connectors listed below. To be sure that you are wiring on the correct pins please use the PINS.pdf document when using any of these connectors. The silkscreen has been corrected and all subsequent Octopus boards will reflect the correct mapping. a. Fans b. SPI3 c. Raspberry pi UART.

Nevertheless, below you will see a figure which will help you to identify which jumpers correspond to the pins that your drivers will use to configure microstepping and we have additionally included a section in appendix A1 which contains the microstepping tables for some of the most common drivers. This should be viewed as a convenience to the user and we still recommend that you consult the datasheet of your driver manufacturer. In the above image the red rectangle isolates one group of driver pins. For the purpose of running the drivers in step/dir mode the pinout can be described as per the table below (note that this is not the actual pinout but rather a simplification for step/dir mode). Connecting jumpers between the upper two rows will set the middle pin (MS) to 0V. Connecting jumpers between the lower two rows will set the middle pin (MS) to 3.3V except for the jumpers in the first column where it will connect SLP and RST. Note that if you are using drivers in step/dir mode that use a microstepping factor other than 16 then you cannot use any other drivers in SPI mode since the pins that are required to set the microstepping to anything other than 16 are also shared with SPI. Note that if you use an A4988 or a DRV8825 driver, you must connect RST and SLP.

They have been included as reminders to prevent damage to your motherboard. Never work on the motherboard with power applied. Always double check all jumpers and wiring before applying power. Improper jumpers or wiring can cause damage to the motherboard and possibly even peripherals that it interfaces with. The motherboard can power heated beds up to 300W. If you are using a bed that operates at a higher power then you will need to use an external MOSFET. Always consult the PIN.pdf diagram when making jumper connections or wiring changes. Assuming a connection order may result in damage to the motherboard. It is recommended to update the firmware using SD card. Using DFU (direct programming via the USB port) will overwrite the bootloader meaning that you will no longer have the option to update via SD card.

Step 2: Remove the protective cover off of the AP board if you are installing on a P1 printer (USB port PCB) or open the plastic cover on the right side of the frame if you are installing on a X1 printer. Step 3: As shown in the image, route the Panda Lux cable along the edge seam to the top. *For additional stability to prevent the cable from moving, use the electrical tape provided in the package to secure the cable firmly to the door frame. Step 4: Disconnect the stock light bar connector from the AP board. Step 5: Connect the Panda Lux cable connector on the adapter board. Step 6: Peel off the double-sided tape on the bottom of the adapter board and stick it on a suitable location. Step 7: Insert one end of the connection cable into the AP board's stock light bar port, and insert the other end of the connection cable into the adapter board. Note: The stock lightbar connector location on X1 series is on the left side of the frame behind the plastic cover. Step 8: Install the protective cover back onto the AP board (close the plastic cover for X1 printers).","title":"Installation Instructions"},{"location":"Panda%20Lux.html#installation-tutorial","text":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QioCo0hEi1I","title":"Installation Tutorial"},{"location":"Panda%20Lux.html#product-purchase-link","text":"https://biqu.equipment/products/panda-lux-led-upgrade-kit If you experience any issues with this product, please contact us and submit a support ticket. https://biqu3d.com/pages/submit-a-ticket","title":"Product Purchase Link:"},{"location":"Panda%20Lux.html#navigation","text":"BIQU Official Website: http://biqu3d.com BIGTREETECH Official Website: http://bigtree-tech.com Online Store: https://biqu.equipment Community: https://community.biqu3d.com","title":"Navigation:"},{"location":"Panda%20P1%20X1.html","text":"P1/X1 \u00b6","title":"P1/X1"},{"location":"Panda%20P1%20X1.html#p1x1","text":"","title":"P1/X1"},{"location":"Panda%20Revo%20P1%20Hotend.html","text":"Panda Revo P1 Hotend \u00b6 Product Link: https://biqu.equipment/products/biqu-panda-hotend Reference Cad\uff1a https://github.com/bigtreetech/Panda_Revo/tree/master/3D Product Profile \u00b6 The Panda Revo, co-developed with E3D, features tool-free, 30-second nozzle changes and a Revo\u2122 HF nozzle for blazing flow rates up to 40mm\u00b3/s, along with a powerful 60W HeaterCore.

here Product Link: https://biqu.equipment/products/bigtreetech-panda-touch-5-display-for-bambu-lab-printers IMPORTANT NOTE \u00b6 The Panda Touch is currently compatible with all Bambu Lab printer firmware versions up until: P1P --> v01.06.01.00 P1S --> v01.06.01.00 X1C --> v01.08.00.00 A1 --> v01.03.01.00 A1 Mini --> v01.03.01.00 It is possible that Bambu Lab may release a future firmware version which impacts the functions available from the Panda Touch. Bigtreetech will monitor all beta firmware versions and if we find a firmware version that affects Panda Touch functionality we will send out an alert via email, Aliexpress chat and our social channels. Buyers can then decide whether or not they would like to perform the update at the risk of losing functionality. Note that the Panda Touch warranty does not cover lost functionality due to a Bambu Lab firmware update being performed. IMPORTANT USAGE INFORMATION \u00b6 When using \"LAN Only\" mode on a P1P or P1S there is no need to connect the Panda Touch to a cloud account and all printer functions will be available from the Panda Touch. When the printer is set to connect to the cloud, you will need to enable cloud mode functionality on the Panda Touch in order to retain the ability to control heaters and printing functions. Please check the firmware listing in the product page description to ensure that your printer firmware is compatible with the Panda Touch. Updating printer firmware to an incompatible version that may limit the functionality of the Panda Touch is not covered under the Warranty. MicroSD card and USB drive files can currently only be read from the root directory and will only be recognized when models are sliced in Build Plate #1 in Bambu Studio and are in 3mf format. Folder browsing and thumbnail previews will come in a future firmware release. When running on its built-in lithium battery, the Panda Touch has a battery life of approximately 20 to 30 minutes depending on the screen brightness. To maintain the battery and extend the lifespan of the product, it is advised to charge the Panda Touch or turn it off as soon as the battery runs out. The screen may flicker when the lithium battery is low on power. This flickering is normal and acts as a warning to users that the battery is almost empty. Users should then promptly charge the battery or turn off the Panda Touch. If you plan to turn your printer on and off frequently then we recommend running the Panda Touch on DC5V mode. This bypasses the battery and prevents the battery from being taken through many charge-discharge cycles. If you want to run off the battery then simply flick the switch on the back of the Panda Touch to the battery power mode.

Packing List \u00b6 Panda Touch x 1 Mounting Bracket x 1 Magnetic Charging Dock x 1 USB-C Charging Cable x 1 M3x6 Screws x 4 Hex Key x 1 BTT Duck x 1 Installing Panda Touch \u00b6 Use the hex/allen key and the two M3x6 FHCS to assemble the Charging Dock and the Mounting Bracket as shown. Peel off the film from the bottom side of the Mounting Bracket. Ensure the printer surface is clean and free of oil, grease, etc., attach the assembled Charging Dock centrally atop the original screen. Apply pressure to adhere fully and allow 12 hours for optimal adhesion. Attach the Panda Touch to the Charging Dock. Wiring and Power Connection \u00b6 Remove the foam covering the USB port on the printer to access the port. Thread the Charging Cable through the hole on the right side of the printer, then plug the USB-C end into the power input of the Charging Dock. Insert the USB-A end of the charging cable into the USB port on the printer to connect the power supply. Then arrange the cable in the clip as shown. TIP: Be 100% sure that you have threaded the cable into the clips to prevent the tool head from catching it during a homing sequence. You have three options on the rear power switch. In the OFF position, the battery will charge but the Panda Touch will not be powered up. When switched to the battery position, the USB will charge the battery and power the Panda Touch at the same time. If the Panda Touch is removed from the dock then the battery will take over and power it for up to 30 minutes. Upon being returned to the dock, the USB will once again resume charging and powering the Panda Touch. This mode is recommended for users who do not turn their printer on and off often. Note that there is no battery charge level indicator. The Panda Touch has been designed for brief periods of use away from a dock and not for prolonged mobile use. When switched to the DC 5V position, the Panda Touch is powered directly from the USB input, while still charging the battery. Removing it from the dock will power it off without the Panda Touch draining the battery. This mode is recommended for users who often turn their printer on and off as it will preserve battery charge cycles. If such users wish to use the Panda Touch in a portable mode then they can flip the switch to battery power after removing it from the dock. Panda Touch has been successfully installed and powered on. Please follow the on-screen instructions for the next setup step. User Interface Instructions \u00b6 First Time Connection Guide \u00b6 You will be presented with the screen below after booting for the first time or after executing the Restore Factory Settings command. Language Selection Guide \u00b6 Choose a language for Panda Touch and press Next WiFi Connection Guide \u00b6 During the initial setup the Panda Touch will scan for WiFi networks and then display up to 20 networks with the best signal strength. If you cannot find your desired network in the list then tap Refresh and the Panda Touch will rescan for WiFi networks. NOTE: The current version of firmware does not support connecting to hidden WiFi networks. Also, when the Panda Touch is connecting to WiFi, it cannot perform the WiFi scanning task at the same time. Click on the WiFi network that you would like to connect to in the list, and the keyboard interface will pop up. After entering the correct password, click \"OK\" to start connecting to WiFi. (Password length: 8~64 characters) NOTE: If you are using a mesh network with several WiFi networks that share the same SSID then select the SSID with the strongest signal strength in the list. The connection status will be displayed next to the name of the WiFi network. A Spinner graphic means that WiFi is still attempting a connection, and a \u2714 means the connection is successful. After the connection is successful, the Next button will be enabled. Click Next to enter the printer connection menu. Printer Connection Menu \u00b6 There are two possible methods to connect the Panda Touch to a printer. Automatic Scanning (recommended). Manual data entry. Finding Your Connection Details \u00b6 During this process you may need to enter connection details. These can be found using the steps below. P1P & P1S \u00b6 Navigate to \"Settings->WLAN\" on the LCD menu, and click \"OK\". Here you will find the IP addess and access code (only Access code is needed for automatic scanning). Find \"Settings->Device\" on the screen menu, and click \"OK\". Here you will find the serial number of the printer. This is only needed for manual entry mode. Automatic Scanning \u00b6 For automatic scanning simply tap the Scan button. Bambu Lab printers that are on the same WiFi network will be displayed in the scan results with the Name , Printer IP , SN and Model information pre-populated. Pre-populating these fields helps to make adding printers easier and can result in fewer mistakes due to manual data input errors. The only data that you will need to enter is the Access Code which can be found within the printer WiFi/LAN menu. Instructions on how to find your access code will be displayed on the Panda Touch screen by tapping the info icon in the bottom left. Printers which have previously been connected to the Panda Touch will still be displayed in the scan results however the Panda Touch will not allow them to be added again and Already added will be displayed near to the printer icon. Once you have entered your access code you can confirm the connection or manually add some of the data below. Manual Data Entry \u00b6 You can click on the printer icon on the left to enter the menu for selecting the printer model. You must set it according to the actual model of the printer you are connecting to. The Panda Touch will also perform some checks in the background to confirm the model. The available models are as follows: P1P P1S X1C A1 mini A1 After selecting a model using the icon, the content in the Model field will be filled with the corresponding model name. After selecting the printer model, there are 4 required fields. These fields contain information necessary to connect to and identify the printer. Tap the i icon and swipe left and right for instructions on how to find this information on your printer. Name : a custom name for users to identify the printer. (length: 1~15 characters) Printer IP : for Panda Touch to connect to printer. (length: 7~15 characters) Access Code : for Panda Touch to connect to printer. (length: 8 characters) SN : for Panda Touch to connect to printer. (length: 15 characters) There are 5 optional fields which may help you to identify certain parameters of the printer during later use. Model : The model name identifies the exact model of the printer and defines what picture is associated with it. P1P , P1S , X1C , A1 mini , A1 , or customized. (length: 0~15 characters) Filament Color : The color of the filament used by the printer. (length: 0~6 characters) Filament Material : The material of the filament used by the printer. (length: 0~6 characters) Nozzle Diameter : The diameter of the nozzle used by the printer. (length: 0~6 characters) Nozzle Material : The type of nozzle used on the printer. (length: 0~6 characters) Confirm button After filling in the required information, you can click the Confirm button to start connecting to the printer. The title bar of the Panda Touch will display the status of the connection. Cloud Mode Functionality \u00b6 If any of your P1P/S printers are not set to LAN Only mode then you are going to need to enable cloud connectivity to them from the panda touch in order to control the functions below: Heating Starting prints Pausing prints Stopping prints NOTE: If your machines are in LAN Only mode then this is not a requirement. Follow the steps below to enable cloud connectivity to those printers that need it. Add a Bambu Cloud Account \u00b6 Tap to jump to the settings page and then tap the Login BambuLab account button. Select your region by tapping the arrow at the top right of the resulting pop up. Users in China use mobile phone numbers, while users in global regions use email addresses. If you are unable to find your login credentials then please see the section: Help I Can't Find My Bambu Lab Login Credentials Tap the confirm button once you've entered the login details. NOTE: Currently, two factor authentication needs to be turned off in order to enable cloud mode on the Panda Touch. If you would like to keep it enabled then you can turn it off, enable cloud mode on the Panda Touch and then turn it back on. Note that you will likely need to repeat this process every three months as the login details will expire on the Panda Touch after that period. Synchronize the printers under the account to the local device \u00b6 After a successful login, you can choose to convert all of your existing printers to cloud mode. We recommend only converting all of the printers if all of your machines run using cloud mode. If any use LAN Only mode then it is better to manually set each machine to cloud mode as described in How To Change Working Mode Between The PandaTouch and Printer . If you want to convert your existing printers to cloud mode then tap \"Yes\". During this process, the printers must be on the same network as the PandaTouch. In case of a poor network connection, you may need to re-edit the printer's IP address. Once a printer works in cloud mode you will notice a green cloud associated with its card in the multi printer view. The cloud indicates the account login status. You will also notice a green arrow pair to indicate the connection status with that printer. How to delete a account \u00b6 Click the \"X\" button in the upper right corner of the account information to delete the account information saved on PandaTouch. After deleting the account information, the communication mode between PandaTouch and the printer will be changed to local mode. Note that this will not set the printer itself to LAN Only mode but rather it will tell the Panda Touch to only speak to the printer using LAN mode which may result in the loss of some functions. How To Change Working Mode Between The PandaTouch and Printer \u00b6 Navigate to the printer/group card page. Find the printer that you would like to enable or disable cloud connectivity for. Scroll down to the Edit button for that printer. Select Enable cloud to set that printer to clould connectivity mode. TIP You must have a cloud account entered into the settings menu otherwise you will not be able to set any printers to cloud mode. Keyboard interface \u00b6 \u2460: Use this key to hide or show the entered information. \u2461: Switch between upper and lower case letters. \u2462: Switch to `Symbol input`. \u2463: Switch to `Number input`. Letter input : Symbol input Number input Filament Control \u00b6 The Panda Touch allows users to configure the type and colour of the filament being used on their external spool holder and their AMS. Users can also load and unload filamement using this menu. When performing any actions, please ensure that the correct AMS unit and filament slot is selected. You will know that the filament is selected when it has a red border around it. If nothing has been selected then the Load and Unload buttons will be greyed out. HMS (Health Management System) \u00b6 Tap the title bar of Panda Touch, and the HMS notification center menu will expand. When a new HMS notification is detected, Panda Touch will automatically expand the HMS notification center. The upper left corner of the title bar will display the number of the printers that have sent HMS notifications. Click on the corresponding HMS notification to pop up the wiki link QR code for troubleshooting this problem. Click X to ignore this notification. Click Ignore All to ignore all notifications. Note: the Panda Touch will ignore notifications from all printers but the X1C. Since the X1C repeatedly sends notification information at regular intervals, ignored notifications may reappear shortly thereafter. Grouping logic \u00b6 The Panda Touch allows you to create up to 10 groups that can each contain individual or multiple printers. How To Add A Group \u00b6 Tap + in the connected printer list to pop up the multi function menu. Choose the add group option. Choose the printers which you want add to the group and ensure that you select which one should be the leader (other printers in the group will follow the commands sent to the leader). Tap next, input the group name and click \"OK\". You now can see the group in the printer list, tapping this group will allow you to control the whole group but the controls presented will be those of the group leader. Switch Between Group and Individual Printer Control \u00b6 To control an individual printer, simply click on the card that corresponds to it and you will notice the name in the top bar change to the name of that printer. You can now send commands to it in isolation even if it is part of a group. If you send a command to an individual printer that takes some time (such as homing) and then you send a command to a group that it belongs to, the second command will be ignored if the first is still busy. To control an entire group, simply click on the card that corresponds to that group and you will notice the name in the top bar change to the name of the group and the name of the leader, separated by a forward slash. You can now send commands to the leader and other printers in the group will follow. Considerations For Printing From USB \u00b6 When trying to print from USB, please take note of the important points below. Ensure that the file system of the USB flash drive is formatted as FAT32 . Export the .3mf file from either Bambu Studio or Orca Slicer using the Export plate sliced file option. Write the sliced .3mf file to the root directory of the USB flash drive Panda Touch only supports files that are sliced on Build Plate #1 in Bambu Studio. Panda Touch only supports .3mf files and does not support .gcode files. Panda Touch only supports reading files in the root directory and does not support reading files in folders. Insert the USB flash drive into the Panda Touch, and then go to the USB flash drive menu. Start Printing With One Printer \u00b6 Tap to choose the file on the USB disk or SD card to print. Set printing parameters. Depending on the printer, you may be presented with: * Bed Leveling * Flow Calibration ( P1P and P1S do not have this feature, so these models of printers will not display this option.) * Timelapse * Use AMS (Panda Touch will automatically identify whether this printer has AMS plugged in and then determine whether this option needs to be displayed.) Please make sure that the sliced .3mf file is compatible with the selected printer. If using an AMS, please make sure that the filaments in the AMS tray are consistent with those in the sliced .3mf file as there is no ability to dynamically map filaments at the start of the print. If you started the print from USB then the Panda Touch will start to upload the files in the USB flash drive to the root directory of the printer's MicroSD card. To avoid issues with the upload, please ensure that: There is an MicroSD card inserted into the printer. The remaining capacity of the MicroSD card is sufficient to write the files to be uploaded. Printing will begin once the upload is complete. For very large .3mf files the transfer time may take some minutes to each printer. After starting the print the Panda Touch will automatically jump to the main interface and display printer data. Group Printing \u00b6 Group printing is only supported with files stored on a USB disk. Tap to choose the file on the USB disk to print. Set printing parameters. Depending on the printers in the group, you may be presented with: * Bed Leveling * Flow Calibration ( P1P and P1S do not have this feature, so these models of printers will not display this option.) * Timelapse * Use AMS (Panda Touch will automatically identify whether this printer has AMS plugged in and then determine whether this option needs to be displayed.) Tick box print options for a particular group will be based on the functionality available for the most functional machine in the group. For example, you are using a group which contains X1C\\P1P\\P1S, you will have the lidar scan option available but this option will only be sent to the printers in the group that support it. Panda Touch will generate a list of available printers for you choose from. Printers and groups that are already busy will be excluded from this list. This means that if a single printer in a group is already busy then you will be unable to print to any printers in that group. This allows groups to always remain in sync with each other. Please make sure that the sliced .3mf file is compatible with the selected printer(s). If using an AMS, please make sure that the filaments in the AMS tray(s) are consistent with those in the sliced .3mf file as there is no ability to dynamically map filaments at the start of the print. The Panda Touch will start to upload the file in the USB flash drive to the root directory of the printer(s) MicroSD card. To avoid issues with the upload, please ensure that: There is an MicroSD card inserted into the printer(s). The remaining capacity of the MicroSD card is sufficient to write the files to be uploaded. Printing will begin once the upload is complete. For very large .3mf files the transfer time may take some minutes to each printer. After you start a print you will be taken to the print summary page where the status of each printer in the group is summarised on individual cards. Group Printing Summary Page \u00b6 When a group is selected and multiple printers in the group are busy printing, the Panda Touch will display the Multiple printing menu as shown below. The following group controls exist from this menu: \u2460: Turn ON/OFF the chamber LED of the printers in the group. \u2461: Stop all print jobs in the group. \u2462: Pause/Resume all print jobs in the group. How To Change The Panda Picture \u00b6 Use this tool to change the picture of the panda. Ensure that you are running firmware version 1.0.3 or above. Currently, the tool only works on Windows. Please ensure that the image you want to replace meets the following requirements: Pixel width less than 280 Pixel height less than 306 Pixel depth 32-bit color Image format PNG. Ensure that the image you want to replace meets the format requirements, rename it, and replace the new_panda.png file in the folder where the tool is located. Click generate_img.bat to compile. Enter the IP address of the Panda Touch in the browser to access the OTA web UI. Click \"Update File,\" select new_panda.img, and proceed with the update. Troubleshooting \u00b6 Help, I Can't Find My Bambu Lab Login Credentials \u00b6 To enable cloud connectivity on the Panda Touch you'll need your Bambu Lab cloud details. If you already know your username and password then you are set! If you created your account using a google login then you'll need to create a password using the steps below: Go to www.bambulab.com and login using your google account. Click on the little user icon at the top right and select \"Profile Setting\". Click on \"Change Password\" and follow the steps to set a password for your account. Connection Troubleshooting \u00b6 Connect Failed \u00b6 This prompt means that the Panda Touch cannot establish a connection with the printer. There are generally several which can cause this: The printer and Panda Touch are not on the same LAN - Check if the WiFi connected to the printer and Panda Touch is the same SSID. If not, connect them to the same SSID. The router restricts communication between devices within the LAN - This is usually the case when using the \"guest\" network of a wireless router. It is recommended to the devices to a normal WiFi network instead of a guest WiFi network. Incorrect printer IP address - The incorrect IP address was typed into the Panda Touch or the IP address of the printer has been changed by the router. Check that the IP address within the Panda Touch matches that of the printer. In a future firmware update, the Panda Touch will be able to automatically find and heal connections that have been broken due to the router changing the IP address of the printer. Incorrect printer SN code - An incorrect SN code was entered. Check that the SN of the printer matches that within the Panda Touch. Weak WiFi signal - Both the Panda Touch and printer have icons displaying WiFi signals, please try to ensure as strong a WiFi signal as possible. Authentication Failed \u00b6 This prompt means that Panda Touch can establish a connection with the printer but authentication has failed. This is usually caused by an incorrect access code. Please check whether the printer's access code matches the set one. An incorrect access code are usually caused by the following: Input error. Clicking the refresh access code button on the printer resulting in the code changing. Enabling / Disabling the printer's LAN mode resulted in the printer generating a new access code. Exiting or logging back into the Bambu Lab account resulted in the printer generating a new access code. Firmware \u00b6 Feature requests \u00b6 If there is something that you would like to see in a coming release of the Panda Touch firmware then please let us know by logging a feature request on the official Panda Touch github repo. Request a feature How to update firmware \u00b6 NOTE: Updating versions V1.0.2 and above requires sending two files to Panda Touch.

Firmware History \u00b6 V1.0.4 \u00b6 Added the ability to log in to the Bambu account on the settings page, supporting the addition of printers to enable cloud mode. This resolves the issue of not being able to initiate printing and heating functions on Bambu P-series printers using the latest firmware via PandaTouch. Added the ability to switch locally added printers to cloud mode in PandaTouch. Added WiFi automatic reconnection feature, which supports automatic connection to the strongest WiFi signal within the same SSID. This resolves the issue of not being able to automatically connect to the strongest same-name WiFi in Mesh networks. Added the ability to sort print files stored on the printer's SD card and external USB drives connected to PandaTouch from newest to oldest. V1.0.3 \u00b6 Add Multi-group feature. Add the ability to change picture of Panda. Add auto select external filament slot with no AMS. Add the feature when operating the axis during a print, a prompt pops up indicating that the operation is not allowed. Add self healing IP address. Add ability to control screen brightness. Add the feature when adding a new printer, the number of scanning printers increases from 10 to 20. Add reprint function, only supports printing tasks launched from Panda touch, will not take action after restarting. Fix unable to load/unload when print is paused. Fix german filenames are now displayed correctly, \u00e4 \u00fc \u00f6 \u00df characters are displayed. Fix wiFi connection instability. If WiFi falls off the network the Panda Touch will attempt three forced disconnect-reconnect cycles. If these still fail then the user is alerted and given an option for a manual reboot. Fix use BSSID as the primary key for WiFi connections instead of SSID. V1.0.2 \u00b6 Add multi-language option, support chinese. V1.0.1 \u00b6 First released factory firmware. The section below discusses how the logic of this firmware version worked. For the latest control logic please refer to the main sections of the user guide. Grouping logic \u00b6 the Panda Touch has 4 settable control modes: Master : A single machine that acts as the source of instructions for itself and possibly other machines. The temperature, filament, and file list in the MicroSD Card displayed by Panda Touch are all derived from this printer. Panda Touch requires that a single printer is set at the Master as the source of this information. All controls on Temperature/Axis and Filament menus are in reference to the Master . The Panda Touch will monitor all print error and HMS messages from the Master in the background and either send them to the notification center if they are non-critical or display them with a pop-up if they are critical. You can start print jobs directly on the master using its internal SD memory. Slave : Slave machines will follow the instructions that the user sends to the Master . For example, instructions such as home , heating , setting filament information and load/unload filament will be followed by all slave machines. This design is for batch control of printers in print farms, so it is recommended that the model and filament (AMS) of Slave machines are the same as those of Master . If they are different, please use Slave mode with caution. All controls on Temperature/Axis and Filament menus will take effect on Slave machines. There can be none or multiple Slave machines at the same time. The Panda Touch will monitor all print error and HMS messages from the Slave machines in the background and either send them to the notification center if they are non-critical or display them with a pop-up if they are critical. You can start a print job on a Slave printer using an external USB drive and selecting the slave printer. Sync : An independent machine that does not follow the instructions sent to the master and slave machines. There can be none or multiple Sync machines at the same time. The Panda Touch will monitor all print error and HMS messages from the Sync machines in the background and either send them to the notification center if they are non-critical or display them with a pop-up if they are critical. You can start a print job on a Sync printer using an external USB drive and selecting the slave printer. you cannot control sync printers using the Temperature/Axis and Filament menus.

Bigtreetech will monitor all beta firmware versions and if we find a firmware version that affects Panda Touch functionality we will send out an alert via email, Aliexpress chat and our social channels. Buyers can then decide whether or not they would like to perform the update at the risk of losing functionality. Note that the Panda Touch warranty does not cover lost functionality due to a Bambu Lab firmware update being performed.","title":"IMPORTANT NOTE"},{"location":"PandaTouch.html#important-usage-information","text":"When using \"LAN Only\" mode on a P1P or P1S there is no need to connect the Panda Touch to a cloud account and all printer functions will be available from the Panda Touch. When the printer is set to connect to the cloud, you will need to enable cloud mode functionality on the Panda Touch in order to retain the ability to control heaters and printing functions. Please check the firmware listing in the product page description to ensure that your printer firmware is compatible with the Panda Touch. Updating printer firmware to an incompatible version that may limit the functionality of the Panda Touch is not covered under the Warranty. MicroSD card and USB drive files can currently only be read from the root directory and will only be recognized when models are sliced in Build Plate #1 in Bambu Studio and are in 3mf format. Folder browsing and thumbnail previews will come in a future firmware release. When running on its built-in lithium battery, the Panda Touch has a battery life of approximately 20 to 30 minutes depending on the screen brightness. To maintain the battery and extend the lifespan of the product, it is advised to charge the Panda Touch or turn it off as soon as the battery runs out. The screen may flicker when the lithium battery is low on power. This flickering is normal and acts as a warning to users that the battery is almost empty. Users should then promptly charge the battery or turn off the Panda Touch. If you plan to turn your printer on and off frequently then we recommend running the Panda Touch on DC5V mode. This bypasses the battery and prevents the battery from being taken through many charge-discharge cycles. If you want to run off the battery then simply flick the switch on the back of the Panda Touch to the battery power mode.","title":"IMPORTANT USAGE INFORMATION"},{"location":"PandaTouch.html#specifications","text":"MCU Xtensa 32-bit LX7 dual-core ESP32S3R8 up to 240MHz clock speed.

Normally, you only need to set the \u201c\u2463 actual path of the .img system\u201d. If the parameters in your software do not match those in the image, manually adjust them to match. \u2460 Find the path where the downloaded RKDevTool is located. \u2461 Open the RKDevTool tool. \u2462 The software will recognize a \u201cLOADER\u201d or \u201cMASKROOM\u201d device. \u2463 Select the system to be written (the OS image must be unzipped as a .img file beforehand; RKDevTool does not support directly writing compressed .xz files). \u2464 Check \u201cWrite by Address\u201d. \u2465 Click \u201cRun\u201d to start writting the system. \u2466 \u201cDownload image OK\u201d indicates that the system has been successfully burned. 5\u3001After writing is complete, toggle the USB OTG switch to the OFF position to boot normally. Note: Files on the eMMC cannot be accessed by the computer like those on a MicroSD card, so you cannot modify the system.cfg configuration file to set up the WiFi network. Instead, use an Ethernet cable or USB-to-UART connection to configure the terminal. Writing System onto eMMC Using a MicroSD Card \u00b6 As shown in the figure, toggle the eMMC switch to the OFF position so that the RK3566 can access the eMMC normally. First, write the system onto a MicroSD card, then insert the MicroSD card into the board's card slot, and wait for the system to boot. Connect to the system's terminal via Ethernet, WiFi, or USB to UART. Log in with the following credentials: login: biqu password: biqu Execute the command sudo nand-sata-install. In the interface that pops up, select \"2 Boot From eMMC - system on eMMC\" and then select \"OK\" \u2460 Select \"Yes\" to start erasing and writing the system onto the eMMC. \u2461 Choose the filesystem \"1 ext4\" and then select \"OK\". \u2462 Wait for the writing process to complete. \u2463 Upon completion, you will be prompted whether to power off. Select \u201cPower off\u201d to shut down the system. \u2464 After the system has powered down, disconnect the power supply, remove the MicroSD card, and then reconnect power. The system should now boot from the eMMC. Erasing eMMC \u00b6 When using a MicroSD card as the system card instead, it's best to erase the data on the eMMC to prevent the motherboard from booting from it by mistake. Using RKDevTool to Erase eMMC (Windows) \u00b6 1\u3001Refer to the steps in \"4.3.1 Using RKDevTool to Write the eMMC (Windows)\" to connect the motherboard to the computer. 2\u3001Open the \"RKDevTool\". \u2460 Find the path where the downloaded RKDevTool is located. \u2461 Open the RKDevTool. \u2462 The software will recognize a \"LOADER\" device. If it recognizes \"MASKROOM,\" it indicates there is no data in the eMMC, hence no erase operation is necessary. \u2463 Click \"Advanced Function.\" \u2464 Click \"EraseAll\" to begin erasing data from the eMMC. \u2465 \"Erasing sectors success\" indicates the erasure is complete. Erasing eMMC After Booting from MicroSD Card \u00b6 1\u3001Refer to the steps in \"4.3.2 Writing System onto eMMC Using a MicroSD Card\" and log into the system terminal. 2\u3001Run the command sudo mkfs /dev/mmcblk1 and then enter \"y\" to confirm. System Configuration \u00b6 Using Ethernet \u00b6 Ethernet is plug-and-play and requires no additional setup. Setting Up WiFi \u00b6 After the system image has been written, the MicroSD card will have a FAT32 partition recognized by the computer. In this partition, there is a \"system.cfg\" file. Open it and replace \"Your SSID\" with your actual WiFi name and \"YourPassword\" with the actual password. Configuring Overlays \u00b6 Open the \"armbianEnv.txt\" file in the BOOT partition and set the values for overlays. The configuration file supports only one line of overlays at a time; if multiple overlays are enabled, only the last line will take effect. If you need multiple overlays, place the contents of multiple configurations on the same line separated by a space. For example, if you need to use a DSI screen, MCP2515 SPI to CAN module, and I2C1 simultaneously: overlays=dsi mcp2515 i2c1 Configuring the Display \u00b6 1\u3001Open the \"armbianEnv.txt\" file in the BOOT partition. 2\u3001The default overlay is set to \"hdmi,\" meaning the system uses an HDMI screen by default. This can be changed to match the actual screen being used, such as: \u00b7 \"hdmi\": HDMI screen \u00b7 \"dsi\": DSI screen \u00b7 \"tft_35\": SPI Screen \u00b7 For \"tft_35\", there is also a \"tft35_spi_rotate\" parameter for system-level screen rotation, with default \"0\" meaning no rotation, other options include \"90\", \"180\", \"270\". Note: Only one screen type can be used at a time. 3\u3001To configure KlipperScreen, open the system.cfg file in the BOOT partition. Set the screen type with the parameter ks_src , and the rotation angle with ks_angle . Using SPI to CAN \u00b6 Open the \"armbianEnv.txt\" file in the BOOT partition and add \"mcp2515\" to the overlays configuration. Using CSI Camera and Crowsnest Configuration \u00b6 For both RPi v1.3 ov5647 and RPi v2 imx219 cameras, no specific configuration in \"armbianEnv.txt\" is required as they are plug-and-play. \"crowsnest.conf\" file configuration is as follows: device: /dev/video0 # The CSI camera node is fixed as video0 custom_flags: --format=UYVY # The current system's CSI camera does not support the default YUYV, so it needs to be set to the supported UYVY format. Using Bluetooth \u00b6 1\u3001 To scan for Bluetooth devices, enter the following command, and a list of Bluetooth devices will appear as shown below: bluetoothctl --timeout 15 scan on 2\u3001Find your Bluetooth device, for example, if your device name is \"HONOR xSport PRO\", locate the corresponding Bluetooth MAC ID as shown below. 3\u3001To connect to a Bluetooth device, enter the following command, connection success is shown as below bluetoothctl connect E0:9D:FA:50:CD:4F \u2460 If there's an issue while connecting, as shown below, please restart the Bluetooth device and repeat steps 1 and 2 to connect. \u2461 If there's an issue while connecting, as shown below, please enter the following commands and then repeat steps 1 and 2: bluetoothctl remove E0:9D:FA:50:CD:4F (Your Bluetooth device's corresponding MAC ID) rfkill block bluetooth sleep 3s rfkill unblock bluetooth pulseaudio -k pulseaudio \u2013start 4\u3001If you exit voice playback during the use of Bluetooth and cannot reuse it, manually delete the corresponding playback process. Use the ps command to view the process number, then use kill -9 process_number to delete the corresponding playback process. Setting up 3.5mm Headphones Port \u00b6 1\u3001Enter the command: aplay -l Check for the corresponding sound card, as shown in the image (the sound card for the headphone port shown in the image corresponds to card 0 ). 2\u3001Enter the command: amixer -c 0 contents (0 represents the card 0 found in the previous aplay -l command) Check the settings for playback and recording channels, as shown in the image. 3\u3001Enter the command: amixer -c 0 cset numid=1 3 Set the playback channel, as shown in the image. 4\u3001 Enter the command: amixer -c 0 cset numid=2 1 Set the recording channel, as shown in the image. 5\u3001Enter the following command to play audio, with the audio file directory xxx and the audio file name xxxxx.wav: aplay -D plughw:0,0 /xxx/xxxxx.wav 6\u3001Enter the following command to record (where 10 represents recording for 10 seconds), storing the recording in directory xxx, file name xxxx.wav: sudo arecord -Dhw:0,0 -d 10 -f cd -r 44100 -c 2 -t wav /xxx/xxxx.wav 7\u3001Enter the following command to play the recording: aplay -D plughw:0,0 /xxx/xxxx.wav SSH Connect to Device \u00b6 1\u3001Install the SSH software Mobaxterm: https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html 2\u3001After powering on, wait for the system to boot, which typically takes about 1 to 2 minutes. 3\u3001Once the device is connected to WiFi or an Ethernet cable is plugged in, it will automatically be assigned an IP address. 4\u3001Access the router management interface to find the device's IP (it should be BTT-CB2 here). 5\u3001Open Mobaxterm and click \"Session\", and click \"SSH\", inset the device IP into Remote host and click \"OK\" (Note: your computer and the device needs to be in the same network). 6\u3001Login as: biqu password: biqu Precautions \u00b6 1\u3001About 10 seconds after powering on, the system enters the kernel phase. At this time, the blue light stays on, and the green light flashes continuously, indicating that the system is running normally. 2\u3001Root administrator: \u200b Login: root \u200b Password: root \u200b BIQU user: \u200b Login: biqu \u200b Password: biqu 3\u3001The PCIe M.2 interface does not support hot-plugging; the solid-state drive must be connected in advance for the device to be recognized. 4\u3001When booting from eMMC, do not insert a MicroSD card.

Firmware Support \u00b6 Supported Firmware: Marlin, Klipper, RRF. Dimensions \u00b6 Peripheral Interface \u00b6 Interface Diagram \u00b6 Pin Description \u00b6 Interface Introduction \u00b6 USB Power Supply \u00b6 After the SKR 3 EZ V1.0 motherboard is powered on, the red light of D7 (Power) in the upper right corner of the MCU will light up, indicating that the power supply is normal. The VUSB in the middle of the board is the power selection terminal. Only when using USB to supply power to the motherboard or need to supply power through USB, you need to use the jumper to make the VUSB short circuit. Motor Voltage Selection \u00b6 Motherboard Power Voltage for Motor Voltage Selection \u00b6 Motor Supply Voltage for Motor Voltage Selection \u00b6 Step Motor Drivers \u00b6 TMC-driven Mode \u00b6 The number of subdivisions needs to be set high or low by firmware to the corresponding subdivision configuration pins. TMC/EZ-driven UART/SPI Mode \u00b6 TMC series drivers do not support the use of both UART and SPI drivers at the same time, for example: X, Y-axis use TMC/EZ2209 (UART), Z, E0 axis use TMC/EZ5160 (SPI). The EZ series drivers support the simultaneous use of both UART and SPI drivers. TMC-driven DIAG mode(Sensorless Homing) \u00b6 As shown in the pictures, plug the jumper cap when using the Sensorless Homing function, and leave it unplugged when not in use. There is no need to cut the DIAG pin of the driver. USB and CAN Mode \u00b6 As shown in the figure below, the double-pole double-throw switch is in USB mode when it is in the pop-up state, and in CAN FD mode when it is in the pressed state. Voltage selection for NC fans \u00b6 If DCIN is used as the power supply of the numerical control fan, a jumper cap should be used to short-circuit the two pins within the VIN range. If you want to use 12V or 5V as the NC fan power supply, you need to make a jumper cap shortcircuit two pins within the VOT range, and insert the SKR 3-DC MODE into the 2*4Pin VOT and VIN headers. Set the VOT output voltage to 5V or 12V by setting the jumper cap on the SKR 3-DC MODE. 100K NTC or PT1000 Setup \u00b6 When using a 100K NTC thermistor, no need to insert a jumper cap. At this time, the pull-up resistors of TH0 and TH1 are 4.7K. When using PT1000, you need to use jump caps to short-circuit the two pins in the red box in the picture below. At this time, the pull-up resistors of TH0 and TH1 are 2.2K Note: the temperature accuracy read out in this way will be much worse than that of MAX31865. BLTouch Connection \u00b6 Completed Shut-down Module(Relay V1.2) Connection \u00b6 Resume Printing(UPS 24V V1.0) Connection \u00b6 RGB Connection \u00b6 Break Detection Connection \u00b6 Touch Screen Connection \u00b6 Heater cartridge IO \u00b6 The IO of the SKR 3 heater cartridge is wired to the MOS by the jumper. You can remove the jumper and connect the IO to device directly if you need to use the laser or other device that need PWM. Note: The IO passes through logic conversion chip, the output high level is 5V, and cannot be used as an input.

Step 1: In the Marlin 2.0 firmware, locate and open the \"Configuration.h\" file, then find the line \"#define MOTHERBOARD XXXXXX\". \"XXXXXX\" represents the model of the board being used. Confirm the motherboard you are using. Step 2: In the Marlin\\src\\pins directory, find the \"pins_xxxxxx.h\" file corresponding to your board (xxxxxx represents the board model), and then locate \"X_CS_PIN\", \"Y_CS_PIN\", \"Z_CS_PIN\", and \"EO_CS_PIN\" within the file. Modify the pin names following these variables to the pins you are using. Step 3: In the file from Step 2, locate \"#define TMC_SW_MOSI XXX\", \"#define TMC_SW_MISO XXX\", and \"#define TMC_SW_SCK XXX\". Change \"XXX\" to the pins you want to use. Step 4: Find and open \"Configuration_adv.h\", then locate \"#define TMC_USE_SW_SPI\" and remove the comment symbols \"//\". Step 5: In the \"Configuration_adv.h\" file, find \"#define X_CURRENT\", \"#define X_MICROSTEPS\", and \"#define X_RSENSE\" and modify the parameters that follow (for each axis being used). The RSENSE value for each used axis should be changed to \"0.022\". Step 6: Set the corresponding axis drive type to \"TMC5160\" in the \"Configuration.h\" file. Klipper Firmware Settings \u00b6 Note: The default sense_resistor in Klipper is 0.075; it needs to be set to 0.022. Precautions \u00b6 Turn off the power before installing the driver to prevent damage. Do not plug or unplug the driver module with power on to avoid damage. Be cautious of polarity when connecting; reversing can cause the driver to burn out. The factory-installed heat sink should not be removed, as doing so will decrease heat dissipation in the absence of thermal interface material. For large currents (greater than 3A), active cooling is required for normal operation. This product uses a 0.022R sampling resistor, so the maximum effective driving current is 10.6A. Pay attention to the power sequence; ensure the driver power is turned on before the logic power. That is, turn on the driver power first, then power on the motherboard. Regardless of whether the driver uses high or low voltage power delivery, the output voltage from the main control board to the drive must not exceed 24V; exceeding this will damage the driver.","title":"TMC5160T Plus"},{"location":"TMC5160TPlus.html#tmc5160t-plus","text":"","title":"TMC5160T Plus"},{"location":"TMC5160TPlus.html#product-profile","text":"TMC5160T Plus is a high-power stepper motor driver control module, featuring 8 high-power MOSFETs separately mounted on the board with a maximum voltage of 60V.

Firmware Setup \u00b6 Klipper \u00b6 Insert your fan port pin into the pin section below and copy it to your \u201cprinter.cfg\u201d file: [fan] pin: # Output pin controlling the fan. This parameter must be provided. max_power: 0.8 # This should be set to 0.8 on most motherboards to give full range of control to your slicer. # Anything above 80% duty cycle will be full power on this particular brushless driver. # To fine-tune the max_power parameter for your particular motherboard, set max_power to 1.0, go into the Klipper dashboard, and increase fan speed 1% at a time until the actual fan speed stops increasing as you increase the fan speed. Divide the fan speed at this point by 100 and enter it into the max_power parameter. # This parameter defines the maximum power (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the pin may be set to. # The value 1.0 allows the pin to be set fully enabled for extended periods, while a value of 0.5 would allow the pin to be enabled for no more than half the time. # This setting may be used to limit the total power output (over extended periods) to the fan. # If this value is less than 1.0, then fan speed requests will be scaled between zero and max_power (for example, if max_power is 0.9 and a fan speed of 80% is requested, then the fan power will be set to 72%). shutdown_speed: 0 # The desired fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) if # The microcontroller software enters an error state. # The default is 0. cycle_time: 0.005 # The amount of time (in seconds) for each PWM power cycle to the fan. # It is recommended this be 10 milliseconds or greater when using software-based PWM. # The default is 0.010 seconds. hardware_pwm: False # Enable this to use hardware PWM instead of software PWM. # Most fans do not work well with hardware PWM, so it is not recommended to enable this unless there is an electrical requirement to switch at very high speeds. # When using hardware PWM, the actual cycle time is constrained by the implementation and may be significantly different than the requested cycle_time. # The default is False. kick_start_time: 0.100 # Time (in seconds) to run the fan at full speed when either first enabling or increasing it by more than 50% (helps get the fan spinning). # The default is 0.100 seconds. off_below: 0.1 # The blower will not spin with the included brushless driver when the duty cycle is below 8%. When scaled with Max_power at 0.8, the off_below parameter should be set to 0.1. # To calibrate this setting, gradually lower the fan speed to determine the lowest input speed that reliably drives the fan without stalls. # Set off_below to the duty cycle corresponding to this value (for example, 8% -> 0.08/Max_power -> 0.08/0.8 -> 0.1) or slightly higher. # This parameter is the minimum input speed that will power the fan (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0). # When a speed lower than off_below is requested, the fan will instead be turned off. # This setting may be used to prevent fan stalls and to ensure effective kick starts. # To calibrate this setting, start with off_below set to 0.0 and the fan spinning. # Gradually lower the fan speed to determine the lowest input speed that reliably drives the fan without stalls. # Set off_below to the duty cycle corresponding to this value (for example, 12% -> 0.12) or slightly higher. #Tachometer_pin: # Tachometer input pin for monitoring fan speed. A pullup is generally required. # This parameter is optional. #Tachometer_ppr: 1 # When tachometer_pin is specified, this is the number of pulses per revolution of the tachometer signal. #Tachometer_poll_interval: 0.0005 # When tachometer_pin is specified, this is the polling period of the tachometer pin, in seconds. # The default is 0.0015, which is fast enough for fans below 10,000 RPM at 2 PPR. # This must be smaller than 30/(tachometer_ppr*rpm), with some margin, where rpm is the # maximum speed (in RPM) of the fan.

You will need the following extra parts to complete the printhead: 1x BTT KNOMI V2.0; 1x 15mm CPAP Tube; 2x Zip Ties To complete the connection from printhead to the Blower, You will need to purchase the 15mm CPAP separately Next, select one of the folders in \"Exhaust parts\" based on your preferred configuration and print everything in the folder. Here are the 4 configurations you can choose from: 1.Voron-Exhaust-UTK-SFS-without-fan: Redesigned version of the Voron exhaust hood with an integrated SFS V2.0 module, making use of the included Air Filter, without the 60mm exhaust fan. This is the recommended configuration as it completely encloses the blower, keeping the noise level to a minimum. For this configuration, you will need the following extra parts: 1x BIGTREETECH SFS V2.0 module 2.Voron-Exhaust-UTK-without-fan: modified Voron design V2.4 exhaust hood without a 60mm exhaust fan. This is the recommended configuration for non-SFS users as it completely encloses the blower, keeping the noise level to a minimum. For this configuration, no extra parts are needed. 3.Voron-Exhaust-UTK-SFS-with-fan: this is a redesigned version of the Voron exhaust hood with an integrated SFS V2.0 module and a 60mm exhaust fan. A powerful 60mm fan is needed to maintain negative pressure in the printer enclosure due to the CPAP blower position; bear in mind that this will produce a high noise level, as the blower isn\u2019t enclosed. For this configuration, you will need the following extra parts: 1x BIGTREETECH SFS V2.0 module; 1x 60mm Axial Fan 4.Voron-Exhaust-UTK-with-fan: original Voron design V2.4 exhaust hood with a 60mm exhaust fan. A powerful 60mm fan is needed to maintain negative pressure in the printer enclosure due to the CPAP blower position; bear in mind that this will also produce a high noise level, as the blower isn\u2019t enclosed. For this configuration, you will need the following extra parts: 1x 60mm Axial Fan The above design is remixed from the following designer, thank you for the inspiration\uff1a https://www.printables.com/model/668556-modified-voron-exhaust-filter https://www.printables.com/model/537863-ws7040-cpap-fan-mount-voron https://www.printables.com/model/574324-stealthburner-knomi-can-sb22092240-cpap-nozzle-cam https://www.printables.com/model/688145-knomi-cpap-stealthburner-sb2240-2209-no-camera/files Product Purchase Link \u00b6 Purchase Link: https://biqu.equipment/products/universal-turbo-kit If you have any issues with the product, please submit a support ticket. https://biqu3d.com/pages/submit-a-ticket Navigation: BIQU Official Website: http://biqu3d.com BIGTREETECH Official Website: http://bigtree-tech.com Online Store: https://biqu.equipment Community: https://community.biqu3d.com","title":"Universal Turbo Kit"},{"location":"Universal%20Turbo%20Kit.html#universal-turbo-kit","text":"Product Link: https://biqu.equipment/products/universal-turbo-kit GitHub repository: https://github.com/bigtreetech/Universal-Turbo-Kit","title":"Universal Turbo Kit"},{"location":"Universal%20Turbo%20Kit.html#introduction","text":"The BIQU Universal Turbo Kit consists of high-quality, high-performance components supplied by Wonsmart Motor (a supplier of medical equipment), along with our self-developed controller adapter board and custom cables, to make your CPAP blower installation experience as easy as connecting a regular DC fan.

A pullup is generally required. # This parameter is optional. #Tachometer_ppr: 1 # When tachometer_pin is specified, this is the number of pulses per revolution of the tachometer signal. #Tachometer_poll_interval: 0.0005 # When tachometer_pin is specified, this is the polling period of the tachometer pin, in seconds. # The default is 0.0015, which is fast enough for fans below 10,000 RPM at 2 PPR. # This must be smaller than 30/(tachometer_ppr*rpm), with some margin, where rpm is the # maximum speed (in RPM) of the fan.","title":"Klipper"},{"location":"Universal%20Turbo%20Kit.html#marlin","text":"Enable \"FAN_SOFT_PWM\" and set \"SOFT_PWM_SCALE\" to 5.

You will need the following extra parts to complete the printhead: 1x BTT KNOMI V2.0; 1x 15mm CPAP Tube; 2x Zip Ties To complete the connection from printhead to the Blower, You will need to purchase the 15mm CPAP separately Next, select one of the folders in \"Exhaust parts\" based on your preferred configuration and print everything in the folder. Here are the 4 configurations you can choose from: 1.Voron-Exhaust-UTK-SFS-without-fan: Redesigned version of the Voron exhaust hood with an integrated SFS V2.0 module, making use of the included Air Filter, without the 60mm exhaust fan. This is the recommended configuration as it completely encloses the blower, keeping the noise level to a minimum. For this configuration, you will need the following extra parts: 1x BIGTREETECH SFS V2.0 module 2.Voron-Exhaust-UTK-without-fan: modified Voron design V2.4 exhaust hood without a 60mm exhaust fan. This is the recommended configuration for non-SFS users as it completely encloses the blower, keeping the noise level to a minimum. For this configuration, no extra parts are needed. 3.Voron-Exhaust-UTK-SFS-with-fan: this is a redesigned version of the Voron exhaust hood with an integrated SFS V2.0 module and a 60mm exhaust fan. A powerful 60mm fan is needed to maintain negative pressure in the printer enclosure due to the CPAP blower position; bear in mind that this will produce a high noise level, as the blower isn\u2019t enclosed. For this configuration, you will need the following extra parts: 1x BIGTREETECH SFS V2.0 module; 1x 60mm Axial Fan 4.Voron-Exhaust-UTK-with-fan: original Voron design V2.4 exhaust hood with a 60mm exhaust fan. A powerful 60mm fan is needed to maintain negative pressure in the printer enclosure due to the CPAP blower position; bear in mind that this will also produce a high noise level, as the blower isn\u2019t enclosed. For this configuration, you will need the following extra parts: 1x 60mm Axial Fan The above design is remixed from the following designer, thank you for the inspiration\uff1a https://www.printables.com/model/668556-modified-voron-exhaust-filter https://www.printables.com/model/537863-ws7040-cpap-fan-mount-voron https://www.printables.com/model/574324-stealthburner-knomi-can-sb22092240-cpap-nozzle-cam https://www.printables.com/model/688145-knomi-cpap-stealthburner-sb2240-2209-no-camera/files","title":"Printed Parts Instruction"},{"location":"Universal%20Turbo%20Kit.html#product-purchase-link","text":"Purchase Link: https://biqu.equipment/products/universal-turbo-kit If you have any issues with the product, please submit a support ticket. https://biqu3d.com/pages/submit-a-ticket Navigation: BIQU Official Website: http://biqu3d.com BIGTREETECH Official Website: http://bigtree-tech.com Online Store: https://biqu.equipment Community: https://community.biqu3d.com","title":"Product Purchase Link"},{"location":"belter.html","text":"Belter \u00b6 Product Link: https://biqu.equipment/products/biqu-belter-high-precision-belt-tension-tool Wiki Link: https://github.com/bigtreetech/Belter-belt-tension-Tool/tree/master Introduction \u00b6 Belter is a high-precision belt tension tool designed to accurately measure belt tension.

Releasing the button allows for programming the EMMC using the RKDevTool. 40 pin GPIO \u00b6 The calculation method for GPIO pins is as follows: GPIO4_B2 = (GPIO4 - GPIO0) * 32 + (\u2018B\u2019 - \u2018A\u2019) * 8 + 2 = 4 * 32 + 1 * 8 + 2 = gpio138 GPIO3_D7 = (GPIO3 - GPIO0) * 32 + (\u2018D\u2019 - \u2018A\u2019) * 8 + 7 = 3 * 32 + 3 * 8 + 7 = gpio127 Flashing the System \u00b6 Download the System Image \u00b6 Only use the image provided in the link: https://github.com/bigtreetech/CB2/releases Write System to MicroSD Card \u00b6 1\u3001Download the balenaEtcher software from [ https://www.balena.io/etcher/ ], install, and run it. 2\u3001Insert the MicroSD card via a card reader. 3\u3001Select your downloaded image. 4\u3001Select the MicroSD card and click \"Flash\" (WRITE the image will format the MicroSD card. Be careful not to select the wrong storage device, otherwise the data will be formatted). 5\u3001Wait for the process to complete. Writing System onto eMMC \u00b6 Using RKDevTool to Write the eMMC (Windows) Download and unzip RKDevTool from the GitHub repository ( https://github.com/bigtreetech/CB2 ) to your computer. DO NOT insert a MicroSD card. 1\u3001Turn the DIP switch 4 (USBOTG) and 3 (RPIBOOT) to the ON position to enter BOOT mode. 2\u3001Then, connect the Type-C cable to the computer. 3\u3001Install the driver: \u200b \u2460 In \u201cDevice Manager\u201d, if you see \u201cUnknown Device\u201d, it indicates that the computer is missing drivers. \u200b \u2461 Open the DriverAssistant tool in the downloaded RKDevTool folder, click \u201c\u2460Uninstall Driver\u201d, then click \u201c\u2461 Install Driver\u201d to ensure that the latest version of the driver is installed. \u2462After the installation is complete, hold down the \u201cRecovery\u201d button, replug the Type-C cable. \"Device Manager\" should now recognize a \u201cRockusb Device\u201d, indicating that the driver installation is successful. \u200b \u2463Open the \u201cRKDevTool\u201d software: Note: The parameters in the software are set by default as shown in the image. Normally, you only need to set the \u201c\u2463 actual path of the .img system\u201d. If the parameters in your software do not match those in the image, manually adjust them to match. \u2460Find the path where the downloaded RKDevTool is located. \u2461Open the RKDevTool tool. \u2462The software will recognize a \u201cLOADER\u201d or \u201cMASKROOM\u201d device. \u2463Select the system to be written (the OS image must be unzipped as a .img file beforehand; RKDevTool does not support directly writing compressed .xz files). \u2464Check \u201cWrite by Address\u201d. \u2465Click \u201cRun\u201d to start writting the system. \u2466\u201cDownload image OK\u201d indicates that the system has been successfully burned. 5\u3001After writing is complete, toggle the USB OTG switch to the OFF position to boot normally. Note: Files on the eMMC cannot be accessed by the computer like those on a MicroSD card, so you cannot modify the system.cfg configuration file to set up the WiFi network. Instead, use an Ethernet cable or USB-to-UART connection to configure the terminal. Writing System onto eMMC Using a MicroSD Card \u00b6 1\u3001First, write the system onto the MicroSD card. Then, insert the MicroSD card into the motherboard's card slot and wait for the system to boot. 2\u3001Connect to the system terminal via Ethernet cable, WiFi, or USB to UART, and log in to the system. login: biqu password: biqu Execute the command sudo nand-sata-install. In the interface that pops up, select \"2 Boot From eMMC - system on eMMC\" and then select \"OK\" \u2460Select \"Yes\" to start erasing and writing the system onto the eMMC. \u2461Choose the filesystem \"1 ext4\" and then select \"OK\". \u2462Wait for the writing process to complete. \u2463Upon completion, you will be prompted whether to power off. Select \u201cPower off\u201d to shut down the system. \u2464After the system has powered down, disconnect the power supply, remove the MicroSD card, and then reconnect power. The system should now boot from the eMMC. Erasing eMMC \u00b6 When using a MicroSD card as the system card instead, it's best to erase the data on the eMMC to prevent the motherboard from booting from it by mistake. Using RKDevTool to Erase eMMC (Windows) \u00b6 1\u3001Refer to the steps in \"4.3.1 Using RKDevTool to Write the eMMC (Windows)\" to connect the motherboard to the computer. 2\u3001Open the \"RKDevTool\". \u2460Find the path where the downloaded RKDevTool is located. \u2461Open the RKDevTool. \u2462The software will recognize a \"LOADER\" device. If it recognizes \"MASKROOM,\" it indicates there is no data in the eMMC, hence no erase operation is necessary. \u2463Click \"Advanced Function.\" \u2464Click \"EraseAll\" to begin erasing data from the eMMC. \u2465\"Erasing sectors success\" indicates the erasure is complete. Erasing eMMC After Booting from MicroSD Card \u00b6 1\u3001Refer to the steps in \"4.3.2 Writing System onto eMMC Using a MicroSD Card\" and log into the system terminal. 2\u3001Run the command sudo mkfs /dev/mmcblk1 and then enter \"y\" to confirm. System Configuration \u00b6 Using Ethernet \u00b6 Ethernet is plug-and-play and requires no additional setup. Setting Up WiFi \u00b6 After the system image has been written, the MicroSD card will have a FAT32 partition recognized by the computer. In this partition, there is a \"system.cfg\" file. Open it and replace \"Your SSID\" with your actual WiFi name and \"Your Password\" with the actual password. Configuring Overlays \u00b6 Open the \"armbianEnv.txt\" file in the BOOT partition and set the values for overlays. The configuration file supports only one line of overlays at a time; if multiple overlays are enabled, only the last line will take effect. If you need multiple overlays, place the contents of multiple configurations on the same line separated by a space. For example, if you need to use a DSI screen, MCP2515 SPI to CAN module, and I2C1 simultaneously: overlays=dsi mcp2515 i2c1 Configuring the Display \u00b6 1\u3001Open the \"armbianEnv.txt\" file in the BOOT partition. 2\u3001The default overlay is set to \"hdmi,\" meaning the system uses an HDMI screen by default. This can be changed to match the actual screen being used, such as: \u00b7 \"hdmi\": HDMI screen \u00b7 \"dsi\": DSI screen \u00b7 \"tft_35\": SPI Screen \u00b7 For \"tft_35\", there is also a \"tft35_spi_rotate\" parameter for system-level screen rotation, with default \"0\" meaning no rotation, other options include \"90\", \"180\", \"270\". Note: Only one screen type can be used at a time. 3\u3001To configure KlipperScreen, open the system.cfg file in the BOOT partition. Set the screen type with the parameter ks_src , and the rotation angle with ks_angle . Using SPI to CAN \u00b6 Open the \"armbianEnv.txt\" file in the BOOT partition and add \"mcp2515\" to the overlays configuration. Using CSI Camera and Crowsnest Configuration \u00b6 For both RPi v1.3 ov5647 and RPi v2 imx219 cameras, no specific configuration in \"armbianEnv.txt\" is required as they are plug-and-play. \"crowsnest.conf\" file configuration is as follows: device: /dev/video0 # The CSI camera node is fixed as video0 custom_flags: --format=UYVY # The current system's CSI camera does not support the default YUYV, so it needs to be set to the supported UYVY format. Using Bluetooth \u00b6 1\u3001To scan for Bluetooth devices, enter the following command, and a list of Bluetooth devices will appear as shown below: bluetoothctl --timeout 15 scan on 2\u3001Find your Bluetooth device, for example, if your device name is \"HONOR xSport PRO\", locate the corresponding Bluetooth MAC ID as shown below. 3\u3001To connect to a Bluetooth device, enter the following command, connection success is shown as below bluetoothctl connect E0:9D:FA:50:CD:4F \u2460If there's an issue while connecting, as shown below, please restart the Bluetooth device and repeat steps 1 and 2 to connect. \u2461If there's an issue while connecting, as shown below, please enter the following commands and then repeat steps 1 and 2: bluetoothctl remove E0:9D:FA:50:CD:4F (Your Bluetooth device's corresponding MAC ID) rfkill block bluetooth sleep 3s rfkill unblock bluetooth pulseaudio -k pulseaudio \u2013start 4\u3001 If you exit voice playback during the use of Bluetooth and cannot reuse it, manually delete the corresponding playback process. Use the ps command to view the process number, then use kill -9 process_number to delete the corresponding playback process. Setting up 3.5mm Headphones Port \u00b6 1\u3001Enter the command: aplay -l Check for the corresponding sound card, as shown in the image (the sound card for the headphone port shown in the image corresponds to card 0 ). 2\u3001Enter the command: amixer -c 0 contents (0 represents the card 0 found in the previous aplay -l command) Check the settings for playback and recording channels, as shown in the image. 3\u3001Enter the command: amixer -c 0 cset numid=1 3 Set the playback channel, as shown in the image. 4\u3001Enter the command: amixer -c 0 cset numid=2 1 Set the recording channel, as shown in the image. 5\u3001Enter the following command to play audio, with the audio file directory xxx and the audio file name xxxxx.wav: aplay -D plughw:0,0 /xxx/xxxxx.wav 6\u3001Enter the following command to record (where 10 represents recording for 10 seconds), storing the recording in directory xxx, file name xxxx.wav: sudo arecord -Dhw:0,0 -d 10 -f cd -r 44100 -c 2 -t wav /xxx/xxxx.wav 7\u3001Enter the following command to play the recording: aplay -D plughw:0,0 /xxx/xxxx.wav SSH Connect to Device \u00b6 1\u3001Install the SSH software Mobaxterm: https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html 2\u3001After powering on, wait for the system to boot, which typically takes about 1 to 2 minutes. 3\u3001Once the device is connected to WiFi or an Ethernet cable is plugged in, it will automatically be assigned an IP address. 4\u3001Access the router management interface to find the device's IP (it should be BTT-CB2 here). 5\u3001Open Mobaxterm and click \"Session\", and click \"SSH\", inset the device IP into Remote host and click \"OK\" (Note: your computer and the device needs to be in the same network). 6\u3001Login as: biqu password: biqu Precautions \u00b6 1\u3001About 10 seconds after powering on, the system enters the kernel phase.

When using CAN communication, you need to see whether it is used as a terminal. If it is, you must plug a jumper cap on the 120R position. When DIY crimping, wire according to the silkscreen, and DIY according to the Pin and Schematic diagrams so as to avoid the power line from being reversely connected or connected to the CAN signal, which will get the module burned. If there's no external power supply during programming via USB port, you need to short the VUSB by jumper cap so as to supply the module with working voltage. The load current of the heater cartridge and the fan interfaces shall not exceed the maximum withstand current to prevent the MOS tube from being burned out. Please pay attention to the precautions in 4.2 Firmware Update to avoid keeping MCU in DFU mode for a long time when the main power supply and hotend are connected. FAQ \u00b6 Q: What's the maximum current for the heater cartridge and fan interface? A: The maximum output current of the heater cartridge interface: 5A. The maximum output current of the fan interface: 1A. The total current for the heater cartridge, driver and fan needs to be less than 9A. Q: Cannot update firmware via USB port?

This parameter must be provided for rectangular beds. mesh_max: 220, 220 # For rectangular beds, defines the maximum X, Y coordinates of the grid. Following the same principle as mesh_min, but this will be the scanning point farthest from the bed origin. This parameter must be provided for rectangular beds. probe_count: 5, 5 # For rectangular beds, this is a pair of comma-separated integers X, Y, defining the number of points probed along each axis. A single value is also valid, in which case the value will be applied to both axes. Refer to https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_Reference.html#bed_mesh The parameter horizontal_move_z in [bed_mesh] should be set to 2 to bring Eddy as close to the bed as possible during scanning. Calibration \u00b6 1\u3001After the above configuration is completed, first calibrate the drive current of Eddy. Position Eddy about 20mm above the platform. Execute in Mainsail's Console: LDC_CALIBRATE_DRIVE_CURRENT CHIP=btt_eddy Save the settings with \u2018SAVE_CONFIG\u2019. 2\u3001Calibrate the relationship between Eddy frequency and Z-axis height. First, home the X and Y axes: G28 X Y Center the nozzle: (ensure there is no height map activated during this step). G0 X150 Y150 F6000 Perform manual z-offset calibration Paper test : PROBE_EDDY_CURRENT_CALIBRATE CHIP=btt_eddy Save the settings with \u2018SAVE_CONFIG\u2019. 3\u3001For printers with z_tilt or quad_gantry_level (QGL) function, run Z_TILT_ADJUST or QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL once to prevent the nozzle from hitting the heated bed during grid scanning. 4\u3001At this point, you can home all axes, then execute the following command for rapid grid scanning: BED_MESH_CALIBRATE METHOD=scan SCAN_MODE=rapid Save the settings with \u2018SAVE_CONFIG\u2019. 5\u3001Temperature Compensation (The coil version has no temperature compensation, ignore this step): Note: Exercise caution as the heated bed can reach very high temperatures. (1) Home all axes. (2) Set the machine's idle timeout longer to prevent a timeout during the heating process: \u200b SET_IDLE_TIMEOUT TIMEOUT=36000 (3) Record Temperatures: \u200b Document the BIGTREETECH Eddy temperature at room temperature. Set the heated bed to its maximum temperature and a commonly used tool head temperature. Wait for the BIGTREETECH Eddy temperature to stabilize and then record the highest temperature reached, which will serve as the target temperature for the next steps. Ensure this target is slightly below the maximum to prevent overheating. (4) Wait until it returns to room temperature and then execute: \u200b PROBE_DRIFT_CALIBRATE PROBE=btt_eddy TARGET=50 STEP=5 \u200b Where TARGET=50 means the target temperature is 50\u2103, and STEP=5 means each node's temperature scale is 5\u2103. \u200b For example, if the current temperature is 30\u2103 and the target temperature is 50\u2103, then the total temperature range is 50-30=20\u2103, and the temperature scale for each node is 5\u2103, so there will be 20 / 5 = 4 nodes sampled. \u200b Executing the above command will immediately require a manual z-offset calibration ( Paper test ). Then manually heat the heated bed and nozzle, waiting for the BIGTREETECH Eddy temperature to rise. The BIGTREETECH Eddy will require another manual z-offset calibration ( Paper test ) at the next node, which is 35\u2103, and then another manual z-offset calibration ( Paper test ) at the next node, which is 40\u2103, and so on.","title":"Eddy"},{"location":"locales/en/Eddy.html#eddy","text":"Product Link: https://biqu.equipment/products/bigtreetech-eddy Eddy Guide Video","title":"Eddy"},{"location":"locales/en/Eddy.html#features-highlights","text":"Compact size and lightweight; Equipped with temperature compensation; Highly efficient leveling; Broad application, strong compatibility; High precision, strong stability; Non-contact operation.","title":"Features Highlights"},{"location":"locales/en/Eddy.html#specifications","text":"Name Eddy Weight 6g Voltage 5V Static Current 30mA Operating Current 30mA Cable Length 2.5 m (USB Version), 15 cm (Coil Version) Connection USB: 4-pin, 1.5mm pitch Coil: 4-2.54mm DuPont female header, one end with ZH1 5mm 4P connector Operating Temperature \u226460\u2103 Ambient Standard Error 0.5\u03bcm Compatible Models All FDM printers using the Klipper firmware","title":"Specifications"},{"location":"locales/en/Eddy.html#dimensions","text":"Note: When installing Eddy, ensure the bottom is at least 1-2 mm above the nozzle.

(4) Wait until it returns to room temperature and then execute: \u200b PROBE_DRIFT_CALIBRATE PROBE=btt_eddy TARGET=50 STEP=5 \u200b Where TARGET=50 means the target temperature is 50\u2103, and STEP=5 means each node's temperature scale is 5\u2103. \u200b For example, if the current temperature is 30\u2103 and the target temperature is 50\u2103, then the total temperature range is 50-30=20\u2103, and the temperature scale for each node is 5\u2103, so there will be 20 / 5 = 4 nodes sampled. \u200b Executing the above command will immediately require a manual z-offset calibration ( Paper test ). Then manually heat the heated bed and nozzle, waiting for the BIGTREETECH Eddy temperature to rise. The BIGTREETECH Eddy will require another manual z-offset calibration ( Paper test ) at the next node, which is 35\u2103, and then another manual z-offset calibration ( Paper test ) at the next node, which is 40\u2103, and so on.","title":"Calibration"},{"location":"locales/en/Extruders.html","text":"Extruders \u00b6","title":"Extruders"},{"location":"locales/en/Extruders.html#extruders","text":"","title":"Extruders"},{"location":"locales/en/H2%20V2S%20Lite%20Revo.html","text":"H2 V2S Lite Revo \u00b6","title":"H2 V2S Lite Revo"},{"location":"locales/en/H2%20V2S%20Lite%20Revo.html#h2-v2s-lite-revo","text":"","title":"H2 V2S Lite Revo"},{"location":"locales/en/H2%20V2S%20Lite.html","text":"H2 V2S Lite \u00b6","title":"H2 V2S Lite"},{"location":"locales/en/H2%20V2S%20Lite.html#h2-v2s-lite","text":"","title":"H2 V2S Lite"},{"location":"locales/en/H2%20V2S%20Revo.html","text":"H2 V2S Revo \u00b6","title":"H2 V2S Revo"},{"location":"locales/en/H2%20V2S%20Revo.html#h2-v2s-revo","text":"","title":"H2 V2S Revo"},{"location":"locales/en/H2%20V2S.html","text":"H2 V2S \u00b6","title":"H2 V2S"},{"location":"locales/en/H2%20V2S.html#h2-v2s","text":"","title":"H2 V2S"},{"location":"locales/en/H2%20V2X.html","text":"H2 V2X \u00b6 Product Link: https://biqu.equipment/products/h2-v2x Github Link: https://github.com/bigtreetech/H2-V2X Introduction \u00b6 The H2 V2X is an ultra-lightweight (145g) direct drive extruder designed for highend CoreXY printers, Precision CNC machined from AL6061 T6 aluminum.

We have customized installation print parts for KNOMI 2, facilitating its easy installation into your Voron StealthBurner. In particular, our StealthBurner Main Body not only retains the original fan positions but also incorporates a circular ventilation opening at the top, enhancing compatibility and optimizing heat dissipation. DOWNLOAD THE PRINTED PARTS https://github.com/bigtreetech/KNOMI MOUNTING PLATE Before you start the assembly, we recommend preparing these two printed parts in advance. The Mounting Plate is designed with a snap-on feature due to size limitations and considerations for the air duct design. This may cause some wear and tear through repeated disassembling and reassembling. Hence, we suggest printing several extra copies of this part for future use. We conducted a comparative analysis measuring wind speed and acoustic energy levels between the original StealthBurner and our customized version featuring vents and KNOMI 2 add-on. The results showed that both versions performed similarly, indicating that adding KNOMI 2 will not compromise the performance of the StealthBurner.","title":"PERFORMANCE COMPARISON TEST"},{"location":"locales/en/KNOMI2.html#packing-list","text":"","title":"PACKING LIST"},{"location":"locales/en/KNOMI2.html#overview","text":"","title":"OVERVIEW"},{"location":"locales/en/KNOMI2.html#configuring-wifi","text":"ROUTER ENCRYPTION MODE Due to device compatibility issues, KNOMI 2 cannot configure networks with WPA PSK encryption mode.

Power Loss Recovery \u00b6 There are two methods for power loss recovery 1\u3001No extra module needed, the motherboard will write current print status to the SD card after every layer is printed, which shortens the life of the SD card severely. #define POWER_LOSS_RECOVERY // enable power loss recovery #define PLR_ENABLED_DEFAULT true // true default to power loss recovery enabled 2\u3001External UPS 24V V1.0 module, when power is cut, the module will provide power to the board and signal the board to save current print status to SD card. This method has virtually no effect on the life of the SD card. #define POWER_LOSS_RECOVERY // enable power loss recovery #define PLR_ENABLED_DEFAULT true // true default to power loss recovery enabled #define POWER_LOSS_ZRAISE 10 // raise the print head by 10mm after power loss to prevent the nozzle from touching the printed part #define POWER_LOSS_STATE HIGH // set signal level, UPS 24V V1.0 returns low level when not triggered and HIGH level when power is cut, thus this setting needs to be HIGH RGB \u00b6 #define NEOPIXEL_LED // enable Neopixel #define NEOPIXEL_TYPE NEO_GRB // set Neopixel type //#define NEOPIXEL_PIN 4 // disable PIN setting, use the correct signal pin in the pin file of the motherboard #define NEOPIXEL_PIXELS 30 // number of LEDs #define NEOPIXEL_STARTUP_TEST // the light will show red green and blue sequentially to self-test If you are using displays like LCD2004, 12864, mini12864, etc., you can also control RGB from your display directly. #define LED_CONTROL_MENU // add led control to your menu. Filament Sensor \u00b6 Standard filament run out sensors are usually comprised of a microswitch which signals the mainboard of filament status with High or Low level signal. #define FILAMENT_RUNOUT_SENSOR // enable filament run out sensor #define FIL_RUNOUT_ENABLED_DEFAULT true // true default to filament run out sensor enabled #define NUM_RUNOUT_SENSORS 1 // number of filament run out sensor #define FIL_RUNOUT_STATE LOW // voltage level of the filament runout sensor trigger signal. Set according to the actual situation of the module. If the module sends a low level when the filament is abnormal, set it to LOW. Smart Filament Sensor (SFS V1.0) \u00b6 The smart filament sensor works by continuously sending signal to the mainboard to communicate filament status. #define FILAMENT_MOTION_SENSOR // set encoder type #define FILAMENT_RUNOUT_DISTANCE_MM 7 // set sensitivity, SFS V1.0 nominal setting should be 7mm, which means if no signal of filament movement is detected after 7mm of filament travel command, filament error will be triggered. The settings below also need to be set to instruct the printer to park the nozzle after filament error is detected. #define NOZZLE_PARK_FEATURE // park nozzle #define NOZZLE_PARK_POINT { (X_MIN_POS + 10), (Y_MAX_POS - 10), 20 } // set the X, Y and Z offset coordinate of the nozzle #define ADVANCED_PAUSE_FEATURE // retraction setting of nozzle park movement and filament purge distance after the print is resumed.

Up to 6 PWM fans and 2 always-on fans with the ability to individually select the voltage rail that will drive each fan. Select from Vin, 12V or 5V. Flyback protection on PWM fan ports \u2013 Many people find that their fan ports become damaged after some time when using larger fans. This is because of the inductance in the fan coils. The octopus includes flyback protection on each fan port which will protect the FETs from damage caused by turning the fans on and off. Includes USB-C interface which supports an emulated serial port that allows printing via USB. Supports all versions of BIGTREETECH TFT screens and LCD12864 screens. Supports multiple languages such as English and Simplified Chinese and can easily switch between different languages (when using the BTT TFT). Includes a bootloader that allows firmware upgrades via the SD card. This offers a simple, efficient, and convenient way to update the firmware. Uses high-performance MOSFETs to increase heating efficiency while also reducing heat generation on the motherboard.

For better viewability please consult the PINS.pdf document. Hardware Configuration \u00b6 Note: The octopus-pro packs a ton of features which necessitates many components and connectors. Given the component and connector density it was not possible to include the silk screen for connector labels on the top. We recommend that you snap a picture of the bottom of the board before starting the installation so that you have a label reference on hand. If you forget to do so then you can always make use of the PINS.pdf file available on our github repo . POWER WIRING \u00b6 The octopus pro provides three separate power inputs: motherboard power, motor power, and bed heater power. This allows a user to use several power supplies with common grounds in order to ensure that they are able to provide the required power to each part of their system. The motherboard power is regulated using a number of switch-mode and low dropout power supplies to provide the supply rails of 12V, 5V and 3.3V. The 12V, 5V and 3.3V rails are made available via various pins on the motherboard. Consult the PINS.pdf document to find a breakout header if you plan to use one of these supply rails. Take note that the 12V rail can supply up to 4A, the 5V up to 8A and the 3.3V up to 1A however, in order to prevent overloading the rails it is not recommended to load them to their maximum capacity since there are already various components on the motherboard which also take their supply from them. Power wiring is as shown below (look on the underside of your board to quickly identify the purpose of each input if the pins file is not on hand). The positive (red) wire from the power supply goes to the terminal marked +. The negative (black) wire from the power supply goes to the terminal marked -. The polarity (+ and -) is also silk screened onto the underside of the board. Note: DO NOT alter the board wiring with the power on and be sure to get the polarity correct otherwise you can damage the motherboard. MCU POWER JUMPER \u00b6 The Octopus can be powered using the USB-C port by inserting the jumper as shown below. This can make it easier to compile and download firmware directly to the motherboard using DFU mode. If you do not connect this jumper then you must provide the board with power via the main input supply if you would like to communicate via USB-C. Hardware Installation \u00b6 AUTOMATIC POWER DOWN WIRING \u00b6 When using the BIGTREETECH Relay V1.2 module, the wiring can be performed as shown in the figure below. Note: Since power will still be supplied to the Relay 1.2 module after it has cut power to the motherboard, it is extremely dangerous to touch the it while the printer is still connected to mains. Always remove all mains power when working on this wiring. BL TOUCH WIRING \u00b6 When using a BL Touch, wire it to the motherboard as shown in the figure below. As always, never perform any work on the motherboard with power applied. POWER LOSS RECOVERY MODULE WIRING \u00b6 When using the BIGTREETECH mini UPS, wire it to the motherboard as shown in the figure below. As always, never perform any work on the motherboard with power applied. RGB LED WIRING \u00b6 When using the motherboard with RGB LEDs you should wire them as shown in the image below. The exact pinout of the connector can be found on the silkscreen on the underside of the motherboard. RASPBERRY PI WIRING \u00b6 The motherboard supports a connection to a Raspberry Pi for printing. There are several connection options available to connect to a raspberry pi. Simplest of all is to connect the raspberry pi directly to the USB-C port which will emulate a virtual serial port on the pi. However, if you have another need for the USB-C port you are still able to connect the raspberry pi to the motherboard using a direct serial connection over UART or SPI. Dedicated UART and SPI pin headers have been made available on the motherboard for this purpose with the pin mappings conveniently printed in silkscreen on the underside of the board for each. It is beyond the scope of this manual to detail exactly how to connect the raspberry pi to either of these headers however there is an abundance of material online that explains how to interface a raspberry pi to an external device over either of these serial busses. 5V power for the raspberry pi is provided via the dedicated Raspberry pi header (UART2). Consult the PINS.pdf document for the exact pinout of this header. PROBE PORT WIRING \u00b6 The probe port has been provided to allow users to interface bed probes directly to the motherboard without the need for a BAT85 diode to act as a protection against high voltages. The probe signal pin connects to an internal optocoupler that in turn triggers the pin connected to the microcontroller. Depending on the type of probe you are using, you may need to add a jumper to activate the internal 12k pull up resistor between the probe positive voltage rail and the probe signal pin. This will be the case if you are using an \u201cNPN\u201d style probe where the output pulls to ground when it is active. You can tell this by checking the output of your probe using a multimeter. If it floats when it is not active (with nothing else connected to it) and then goes to ground when it is active, it is an NPN style probe. If it goes to the positive rail when active then it is a PNP style probe. The image below shows where the jumper to activate the 12k pull up resistor is located. Regardless of the kind of probe you are using, you will need to enable the internal pulldown resistor on the probe input pin in order for it to generate an output signal. Please refer to the pin configuration instructions for the specific firmware that you are using to find out how to enable a pull down resistor on the probe input pin (PC5). Refer to Section 4.2 for further information on how to configure the voltage used by the probe port. STEPPER DRIVER OPERATIONAL MODES \u00b6 STEP/DIR MODE \u00b6 If you are using drivers that do not support configuration over a serial port then you will need to operate them in step/dir mode and set the jumpers beneath the stepper driver according to the microstepping you desire. Each driver will have its own microstepping table so we do not attempt to speak on behalf of the driver manufacturer in our manual. Please consult the datasheet of your driver to determine what signals need to be applied to the microstepping configuration pins in order to achieve the microstepping you desire. Nevertheless, below you will see a figure which will help you to identify which jumpers correspond to the pins that your drivers will use to configure microstepping and we have additionally included a section in appendix A1 which contains the microstepping tables for some of the most common drivers. This should be viewed as a convenience to the user and we still recommend that you consult the datasheet of your driver manufacturer. In the above image the red rectangle isolates the groups of driver pins. For the purpose of running the drivers in step/dir mode the pinout can be described as per the table below. Note that this is not the actual pinout but rather a simplification for step/dir mode. Connecting jumpers between the lower two rows will set the middle pin (MS) to 5V except for the jumpers in the first column where it will connect SLP and RST. Note that if your stepper driver requires 0V to be present on any of the pins then there is actually no need to connect a jumper to that pin when running in step/dir mode and connecting a jumper in this instance could cause interference since those lines are used for the SPI bus. Note that if you use an A4988 or a DRV8825 driver, you must connect RST and SLP. For details, please click: https://z1996xm.github.io/BIGTREETECH/Tutorials.html UART MODE \u00b6 When using a driver in UART mode, connect the jumpers beneath that driver as show in the image below. SPI MODE \u00b6 When using a driver in SPI mode, connect the jumpers beneath that driver as shown in the image below. MOTHERBOARD JUMPER SETTINGS \u00b6 MOTOR POWER SELECTION JUMPERS \u00b6 Each motor driver on the octopus pro can have the voltage used by it configured via a jumper. Note: Before powering your octopus pro, always double check the driver voltage jumpers to ensure that the correct voltage is being routed to each driver. Sending a high voltage to a driver that is not rated for it is likely to destroy it and may even cause damage to the motherboard. Setting the jumper for any given driver to the right, as shown in the image below, will provide the motherboard input voltage for that driver to use. Generally the motherboard uses 24V. Setting the jumper for any given driver to the left, as shown in the image below, will provide the motor input voltage for that driver to use. This can be up to 60V. Note: Never remove or insert a jumper when power is applied to either the board input or the motor input. FAN AND PROXIMITY SWITCH VOLTAGE SETTINGS \u00b6 The Octopus features 6 PWM fan outputs and two \u201calways on\u201d fan outputs. There is also a dedicated pin header for a proximity sensor or probe. All of the fan outputs and the proximity sensor input can individually have the voltage supplied by their pin header selected by configuring the jumpers associated with each header. Configure the jumpers as below to select 24V (note that all are shown in the same configuration even though they can be individually configured). Configure the jumpers as below to select 12V. Configure the jumpers as below for 5V. Note: Since the jumpers carry a voltage rail directly from one of the regulators or from the input, if you short the jumpers in any way other than the shown connections, you will likely cause damage to the motherboard. When connecting the fan, make sure that you connect the positive terminal to the positive output as shown in the images. STALLGUARD JUMPER SETTINGS \u00b6 The \u201cdiag\u201d jumpers which are used to connect the diagnostic output pin to the endstop inputs for drivers which support the stallguard feature (TMC2209/TMC2226, etc\u2026) can be found in the location shown in the image below. The exact diag numbering can be found by looking at the pins file or the silkscreen beneath the board. PT100/PT1000 DIP SWITCHES \u00b6 The PT100 amplifier supports 2,3 and 4 wire connections to the board. However, the DIP switch needs to be configured for the setup that you are using. You can find the DIP switch in the location shown in the image below. Note that the DIP switch has switch numbers and the \u201con\u201d position printed on it. Select the connection arrangement for your thermistor according to the table below. Bear in mind that you will still need to configure your firmware using the correct sense resistor values which will be 430\uf057 for the PT100 and 4300\uf057 for the PT1000. 1 2 3 4 Sensor model ON ON ON OFF Two-wire PT100 ON ON OFF ON Two-wire PT1000 OFF ON ON OFF Three-wire PT100 OFF ON OFF ON Three-wire PT1000 If you are using a three-wire arrangement, then you will also need to make a small adjustment to an SMD resistor on the board. The image below shows the factory default resistor setting in the blue box (2/4 wire arrangement). Using a 3 wire arrangement will require you to move the resistor from the blue box into the red box and then to leave the pads in the blue box unpopulated. These resistors are 0\uf057 so if you do not feel comfortable soldering them back in place you can always just create a solder bridge between the pads instead, selecting the pads appropriate to your arrangement. Software Installation \u00b6 COMMUNICATING WITH THE MOTHERBOARD \u00b6 After connecting the motherboard to a computer via a USB cable, the driver will be automatically installed (windows, linux and macos). Upon installation of the driver the motherboard should automatically enumerate as a virtual serial device which can be used for data transfer. If it fails to do so, you can visit our GitHub website: https://github.com/bigtreetech?tab=repositories and find the corresponding repository to download the driver. If you would like to confirm that the driver has been installed correctly you can access the device manager in windows and look for a virtual com port when the motherboard is plugged in. In the image below the motherboard has been assigned COM7 however your operating system may assign it any available COM port number. Other operating systems will list serial ports in a different manner. MOTHERBOARD FIRMWARE SUPPORT \u00b6 Marlin, Klipper and RRF (429 variant) all support the Octopus Pro. You can compile and configure you firmware variant of choice according to the methods specified by the developers of that firmware. In time, configuration files for different firmware distributions will be made available on the octopus-pro github . Covering how to compile firmware using VSCode is beyond the scope of this manual however there is an abundance of information online which explains how to set up VSCode on your machine and how to configure Marlin thereafter. Good places to start are provided for your convenience in the links below: \u2022 https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio_vscode.html \u2022 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq_ygvHF29I Once you have either compiled your own version of Marlin or downloaded a pre-compiled version, you can install it by following the steps below: Make sure that the firmware binary is named \u201cfirmware.bin\u201d. Any other name will be rejected by the bootloader. Use an SD card that has been formatted using the SD formatter tool here: https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/ Copy the firmware binary file to the SD card. Insert the SD card into the motherboard and reset it. Remove the SD card and check that the file has changed name to \u201cFIRMWARE.CUR\u201d. This will confirm that the firmware was successfully installed. If you are using Klipper then please ensure that you have the following settings enabled for the 446 variant. Take careful note of the crystal oscillator frequency which is 12MHz and differs from the 429 variant. The 429 variant of the board makes use of a different frequency crystal oscillator (8MHz) and therefore the klipper configuration needs to be adjusted slightly as show in in the image below. PRECAUTIONS \u00b6 The precautions listed in this section should not be overlooked. They have been included as reminders to prevent damage to your motherboard. Never work on the motherboard with power applied. Always double check all jumpers and wiring before applying power. Improper jumpers or wiring can cause damage to the motherboard and possibly even peripherals that it interfaces with. The motherboard can power heated beds up to 300W. If you are using a bed that operates at a higher power then you will need to use an external MOSFET. Do not connect a voltage source greater than 28V to this input. Never short circuit the 3.3V, 5V, 12V or 24V supplies to each other. Doing so will let out some smoke and BTT will not be able to put it back for you. You cannot power external devices using the USB-C interface. It is designed for data only. Always consult the PIN.pdf diagram when making jumper connections or wiring changes. Assuming a connection order may result in damage to the motherboard. It is recommended to update the firmware using SD card. Using DFU (direct programming via the USB port) will overwrite the bootloader meaning that you will no longer have the option to update via SD card unless you reflash the bootloader.

The probe signal pin connects to an internal optocoupler that in turn triggers the pin connected to the microcontroller. Depending on the type of probe you are using, you may need to add a jumper to activate the internal 12k pull up resistor between the probe positive voltage rail and the probe signal pin. This will be the case if you are using an \u201cNPN\u201d style probe where the output pulls to ground when it is active. You can tell this by checking the output of your probe using a multimeter. If it floats when it is not active (with nothing else connected to it) and then goes to ground when it is active, it is an NPN style probe. If it goes to the positive rail when active then it is a PNP style probe. The image below shows where the jumper to activate the 12k pull up resistor is located. Regardless of the kind of probe you are using, you will need to enable the internal pulldown resistor on the probe input pin in order for it to generate an output signal. Please refer to the pin configuration instructions for the specific firmware that you are using to find out how to enable a pull down resistor on the probe input pin (PC5).

For better viewability please consult the PINS.pdf document. Hardware Configuration \u00b6 POWER WIRING \u00b6 The octopus provides three separate power inputs: motherboard power, motor power, and bed heater power. This allows a user to use several power supplies with common grounds in order to ensure that they are able to provide the required power to each part of their system. The motherboard power is regulated using a number of switch-mode and low dropout power supplies to provide the supply rails of 12V, 5V and 3.3V. The 12V, 5V and 3.3V rails are made available via various pins on the motherboard. Consult the PINS.pdf document to find a breakout header if you plan to use one of these supply rails. Take note that the 12V rail can supply up to 4A, the 5V up to 8A and the 3.3V up to 1A however, in order to prevent overloading the rails it is not recommended to load them to their maximum capacity since there are already various components on the motherboard which also take their supply from them. Power wiring is as shown below (look on the underside of your board to identify the purpose of each input). The positive (red) wire from the power supply goes to the terminal marked +. The negative (black) wire from the power supply goes to the terminal marked -. The polarity (+ and -) is also silk screened onto the underside of the board as a convenience to the user. Note: DO NOT alter the board wiring with the power on and be sure to get the polarity correct, otherwise you can cause damage to the motherboard. MCU POWER JUMPER \u00b6 The Octopus can be powered using the USB-C port by inserting the jumper as shown below. This can make it easier to compile and download firmware directly to the motherboard using DFU mode. If you do not connect this jumper then you must provide the board with power via the main input supply if you would like to communicate via USB-C Hardware Installation \u00b6 AUTOMATIC POWER DOWN WIRING \u00b6 When using the BIGTREETECH Relay V1.2 module, the wiring can be performed as shown in the figure below. Note: Since power will still be supplied to the Relay 1.2 module after it has cut power to the motherboard, it is extremely dangerous to touch the Relay 1.2 module while the printer is still connected to mains. Always remove all mains power when working on this wiring. BL TOUCH WIRING \u00b6 When using a BL Touch, wire it to the motherboard as shown in the figure below. As always, never perform any work on the motherboard with power applied. POWER LOSS RECOVERY MODULE WIRING \u00b6 When using the BIGTREETECH mini UPS, wire it to the motherboard as shown in the figure below. As always, never perform any work on the motherboard with power applied. RGB LED WIRING \u00b6 When using the motherboard with RGB LEDs you should wire them as shown in the image below. The exact pinout of the connector can be found on the silkscreen on the underside of the motherboard. RASPBERRY PI WIRING \u00b6 Note: The 3.3V and GND pins for the SPI3 port were erroneously swapped on the silkscreen on the underside of some early boards. To be sure of the exact pinout please reference the PIN.pdf document for the SPI3 port. The motherboard supports a connection to a Raspberry Pi for printing. There are several connection options available to connect to a raspberry pi. Simplest of all is to connect the raspberry pi directly to the USB-C port which will emulate a virtual serial port on the pi. However, if you have another need for the USB-C port you are still able to connect the raspberry pi to the motherboard using a direct serial connection over UART or SPI. Dedicated UART and SPI pin headers have been made available on the motherboard for this purpose with the pin mappings conveniently printed in silkscreen on the underside of the board for each. It is beyond the scope of this manual to detail exactly how to connect the raspberry pi to either of these headers however there is an abundance of material online that explains how to interface a raspberry pi to an external device over either of these serial busses. 5V power for the raspberry pi is provided via the dedicated Raspberry pi header. Consult the PINS.pdf document for the exact pinout of this header. PROBE PORT WIRING \u00b6 The probe port has been provided to allow users to interface bed probes directly to the motherboard without the need for a BAT85 diode to act as a protection against high voltages. The probe signal pin connects to an internal optocoupler that in turn triggers the pin connected to the microcontroller. Depending on the type of probe you are using, you may need to add an external 4k7 pull up resistor between the probe positive voltage rail and the probe signal pin in order to get a reading. This will be the case if you are using an \u201cNPN\u201d style probe where the output pulls to ground when it is active. You can tell this by checking the output of your probe using a multimeter. If it floats when it is not active (with nothing else connected to it) and then goes to ground when it is active, it is an NPN style probe. If it goes to the positive rail when active then it is a PNP style probe. The image below shows how to connect the external 4k7 resistor when using an NPN probe. Regardless of the kind of probe you are using, you will need to enable the internal pulldown resistor on the probe input pin in order for it to generate an output signal. Please refer to the pin configuration instructions for the specific firmware that you are using to find out how to enable a pull down resistor on the probe input pin. STEPPER DRIVER OPERATIONAL MODES \u00b6 Note: The octopus packs a ton of features which means there are many connectors and components. In order to keep the board size to a minimum we placed the stepper sockets close to each other. This means that drivers will have a snug fit. STEP/DIR MODE \u00b6 If you are using drivers that do not support configuration over a serial port then you will need to operate them in step/dir mode and set the jumpers beneath the stepper driver according to the microstepping you desire. Each driver will have its own microstepping table so we do not attempt to speak on behalf of the driver manufacturer in our guide. Please consult the datasheet of your driver to determine what signals need to be applied to the microstepping configuration pins in order to achieve the microstepping you desire. Nevertheless, below you will see a figure which will help you to identify which jumpers correspond to the pins that your drivers will use to configure microstepping and we have additionally included a section in appendix A1 which contains the microstepping tables for some of the most common drivers. This should be viewed as a convenience to the user and we still recommend that you consult the datasheet of your driver manufacturer. In the above image the red rectangle isolates one group of driver pins. For the purpose of running the drivers in step/dir mode the pinout can be described as per the table below (note that this is not the actual pinout but rather a simplification for step/dir mode). Connecting jumpers between the upper two rows will set the middle pin (MS) to 0V. Connecting jumpers between the lower two rows will set the middle pin (MS) to 3.3V except for the jumpers in the first column where it will connect SLP and RST. Note that if you are using drivers in step/dir mode that use a microstepping factor other than 16 then you cannot use any other drivers in SPI mode since the pins that are required to set the microstepping to anything other than 16 are also shared with SPI. Note that if you use an A4988 or a DRV8825 driver, you must connect RST and SLP. For details, please click: https://bigtreetech.github.io/docs/Tutorials.html UART MODE \u00b6 When using a driver in UART mode, connect the jumpers beneath that driver as show in the image below. SPI MODE \u00b6 When using a driver in SPI mode, connect the jumpers beneath that driver as shown in the image below. MOTHERBOARD JUMPER SETTINGS \u00b6 FAN AND PROXIMITY SWITCH SETTINGS \u00b6 The Octopus features 6 PWM fan outputs and two \u201calways on\u201d fan outputs. There is also a dedicated pin header for a proximity sensor. These headers are shown in the image below. Note: The polarity of the fan ports was erroneously swapped on the silkscreen on the underside of some early boards. To be sure of the correct polarity, please consult the PINS.pdf document or see the images below. All of the fan outputs and the proximity sensor input can individually have the voltage supplied by their pin header selected by configuring the jumpers associated with each header. Configure the jumpers as below to select 12V. Configure the jumpers as below for 5V. Note: Since the jumpers carry a voltage rail directly from one of the regulators or from the input, if you short the jumpers in any way other than the shown connections, you will likely cause damage to the motherboard. When connecting the fan, make sure that you connect the positive terminal to the positive output as shown in the images. STALLGUARD JUMPER SETTINGS \u00b6 The \u201cdiag\u201d jumpers which are used to connect the diagnostic output pin to the endstop inputs for drivers which support the stallguard feature (TMC2209/TMC2226) can be found in the location shown in the image below. The exact diag numbering can be found by looking at the pins file or the silkscreen beneath the board. SPECIAL NOTE ON EXPANSION INTERFACES \u00b6 Expansion interfaces are provided for SPI, UART and I2C. In the very first production run of the Octopus the silkscreen on the underside of the PCB had two pins that were mislabeled on the SPI3 interface and two on the Raspberry Pi UART interface. To be sure that you are connecting your peripheral correctly, please refer to the PINS.pdf document if using the SPI or UART interface. Software Installation \u00b6 COMMUNICATING WITH THE MOTHERBOARD \u00b6 After connecting the motherboard to a computer via a USB cable, the driver will be automatically installed (windows, linux and macos). Upon installation of the driver the motherboard should automatically enumerate as a virtual serial device which can be used for data transfer. If it fails to do so, you can visit our GitHub website: https://github.com/bigtreetech?tab=repositories and find the corresponding repository to download the driver. If you would like to confirm that the driver has been installed correctly you can access the device manager in windows and look for a virtual com port when the motherboard is plugged in. In the image below the motherboard has been assigned COM7 however your operating system may assign it any available COM port number. Other operating systems will list serial ports in a different manner. MOTHERBOARD FIRMWARE SUPPORT \u00b6 You can find a pre-compiled version of Marlin for the Octopus by visiting https://github.com/bigtreetech?tab=repositories and looking for the Octopus repository. Alternately you can compile your own version using VScode. Covering how to compile firmware using VSCode is beyond the scope of this manual however there is an abundance of information online which explains how to set up VSCode on your machine and how to configure Marlin thereafter. Good places to start are provided for your convenience in the links below: \u2022 https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio_vscode.html \u2022 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq_ygvHF29I Once you have either compiled your own version of Marlin or downloaded a pre-compiled version, you can install it by following the steps below: Make sure that the firmware binary is named \u201cfirmware.bin\u201d. Any other name will be rejected by the bootloader. **Use an SD card that has been formatted using the SD formatter tool here: https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/** Copy the firmware binary file to the SD card. Insert the SD card into the motherboard and reset it. Remove the SD card and check that the file has changed name to \u201cFIRMWARE.CUR\u201d. This will confirm that the firmware was successfully installed. If you are using Klipper then please ensure that you have the following settings enabled in order to download the firmware to the board while preserving the factory bootloader: PRECAUTIONS \u00b6 The precautions listed in this section should not be overlooked. They have been included as reminders to prevent damage to your motherboard. Never work on the motherboard with power applied. Always double check all jumpers and wiring before applying power. Improper jumpers or wiring can cause damage to the motherboard and possibly even peripherals that it interfaces with. The motherboard can power heated beds up to 300W. If you are using a bed that operates at a higher power then you will need to use an external MOSFET. Always consult the PIN.pdf diagram when making jumper connections or wiring changes. Assuming a connection order may result in damage to the motherboard. It is recommended to update the firmware using SD card. Using DFU (direct programming via the USB port) will overwrite the bootloader meaning that you will no longer have the option to update via SD card. The stock Octopus does not come with a INA826AIDR amplifier chip. If you want to use the PT100 interface, you need to purchase a INA826AIDR chip (SOP-8 Package) separately and solder the chip into the correct position as shown below. The silkscreen on the first production run of the octopus had incorrectly labeled pins on the connectors listed below. To be sure that you are wiring on the correct pins please use the PINS.pdf document when using any of these connectors. The silkscreen has been corrected and all subsequent Octopus boards will reflect the correct mapping. a. Fans b. SPI3 c. Raspberry pi UART.

Up to 6 PWM fans and 2 always-on fans with the ability to individually select the voltage rail that will drive each fan. Select from Vin, 12V or 5V. Flyback protection on PWM fan ports \u2013 Many people find that their fan ports become damaged after some time when using larger fans. This is because of the inductance in the fan coils. The octopus includes flyback protection on each fan port which will protect the FETs from damage caused by turning the fans on and off. Includes USB-C interface which supports an emulated serial port that allows printing via USB. Supports all versions of BIGTREETECH TFT screens and LCD12864 screens.

Any other name will be rejected by the bootloader. **Use an SD card that has been formatted using the SD formatter tool here: https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/** Copy the firmware binary file to the SD card. Insert the SD card into the motherboard and reset it. Remove the SD card and check that the file has changed name to \u201cFIRMWARE.CUR\u201d. This will confirm that the firmware was successfully installed. If you are using Klipper then please ensure that you have the following settings enabled in order to download the firmware to the board while preserving the factory bootloader:","title":"MOTHERBOARD FIRMWARE SUPPORT"},{"location":"locales/en/Octopus.html#precautions","text":"The precautions listed in this section should not be overlooked. They have been included as reminders to prevent damage to your motherboard. Never work on the motherboard with power applied. Always double check all jumpers and wiring before applying power. Improper jumpers or wiring can cause damage to the motherboard and possibly even peripherals that it interfaces with. The motherboard can power heated beds up to 300W. If you are using a bed that operates at a higher power then you will need to use an external MOSFET. Always consult the PIN.pdf diagram when making jumper connections or wiring changes. Assuming a connection order may result in damage to the motherboard. It is recommended to update the firmware using SD card. Using DFU (direct programming via the USB port) will overwrite the bootloader meaning that you will no longer have the option to update via SD card. The stock Octopus does not come with a INA826AIDR amplifier chip. If you want to use the PT100 interface, you need to purchase a INA826AIDR chip (SOP-8 Package) separately and solder the chip into the correct position as shown below. The silkscreen on the first production run of the octopus had incorrectly labeled pins on the connectors listed below. To be sure that you are wiring on the correct pins please use the PINS.pdf document when using any of these connectors. The silkscreen has been corrected and all subsequent Octopus boards will reflect the correct mapping. a. Fans b. SPI3 c.

Bigtreetech will monitor all beta firmware versions and if we find a firmware version that affects Panda Touch functionality we will send out an alert via email, Aliexpress chat and our social channels. Buyers can then decide whether or not they would like to perform the update at the risk of losing functionality. Note that the Panda Touch warranty does not cover lost functionality due to a Bambu Lab firmware update being performed. IMPORTANT USAGE INFORMATION \u00b6 When using \"LAN Only\" mode, firmware versions below V1.05.01.00 on the P1P/S will only allow either the Panda Touch or Bambu Studio to connect to the printer at one time. Firmware versions above that will allow both connections simultaneously. When using \"Cloud\" mode, firmware versions below V1.05.01.00 on the P1P/S will allow both Bambu Studio and the Panda Touch to connect simultaneously. However, they will not allow a third device such as Home Assistant to connect. Firmware versions above that will allow all three simultaneous connections. Please check the firmware listing in the product page description to ensure that your printer firmware is compatible with the Panda Touch. Updating printer firmware to an incompatible version that may limit the functionality of the Panda Touch is not covered under the Warranty. MicroSD card and USB drive files can currently only be read from the root directory and will only be recognized when models are sliced in Build Plate #1 in Bambu Studio and are in 3mf format. When running on its built-in lithium battery, the Panda Touch has a battery life of 30 minutes. To maintain the battery and extend the lifespan of the product, it is advised to charge the Panda Touch or turn it off as soon as the battery runs out. The screen may flicker when the lithium battery is low on power. This flickering is normal and acts as a warning to users that the battery is almost empty. Users should then promptly charge the battery or turn off the Panda Touch. If you plan to turn your printer on and off frequently then we recommend running the Panda Touch on USB direct mode. This bypasses the battery and prevents the battery from being taken through many charge-discharge cycles. If you want to run off the battery then simply flick the switch on the back of the Panda Touch to the battery power mode.

Packing list \u00b6 Panda Touch x 1 Mounting Bracket x 1 Magnetic Charging Dock x 1 USB-C Charging Cable x 1 M3x6 Screws x 4 Hex Key x 1 BTT Duck x 1 Installing Panda Touch \u00b6 Use the hex/allen key and the two M3x6 FHCS to assemble the Charging Dock and the Mounting Bracket as shown. Peel off the film from the bottom side of the Mounting Bracket. Ensure the printer surface is clean and free of oil, grease, etc., attach the assembled Charging Dock centrally atop the original screen. Apply pressure to adhere fully and allow 12 hours for optimal adhesion. Attach the Panda Touch to the Charging Dock. Wiring and Power Connection \u00b6 Remove the foam covering the USB port on the printer to access the port. Thread the Charging Cable through the hole on the right side of the printer, then plug the USB-C end into the power input of the Charging Dock. Insert the USB-A end of the charging cable into the USB port on the printer to connect the power supply. Then arrange the cable in the clip as shown. You have three options on the rear power switch. In the OFF position, the battery will charge but the Panda Touch will not be powered up. When switched to the battery position, the USB will charge the battery and power the Panda Touch at the same time. If the Panda Touch is removed from the dock then the battery will take over and power it for up to 30 minutes. Upon being returned to the dock, the USB will once again resume charging and powering the Panda Touch. This mode is recommended for users who do not turn their printer on and off often. Note that there is no battery charge level indicator. The Panda Touch has been designed for brief periods of use away from a dock and not for prolonged mobile use. When switched to the DC 5V position, the Panda Touch is powered directly from the USB input, while still charging the battery. Removing it from the dock will power it off without the Panda Touch draining the battery. This mode is recommended for users who often turn their printer on and off as it will preserve battery charge cycles. If such users wish to use the Panda Touch in a portable mode then they can flip the switch to battery power after removing it from the dock. Panda Touch has been successfully installed and powered on. Please follow the on-screen instructions for the next setup step. User Interface Instructions \u00b6 First time connection guide \u00b6 You will be presented with the screen below after booting for the first time or after executing the Restore Factory Settings command. Language select guide \u00b6 Choose a language for Panda Touch WiFi connection guide \u00b6 During the initial setup the Panda Touch will scan for WiFi networks and then display upt to 20 networks with the best signal strength. If you cannot find your desired network in the list then tap Refresh and the Panda Touch will rescan for WiFi networks. Note: Currently version of the firmware does not support connecting to hidden WiFi networks.

Click Next to enter the printer connection menu. Printer connection menu \u00b6 There are two possible methods to connect the Panda Touch to a printer. Automatic Scanning (recommended). Manual data entry. Automatic Scanning \u00b6 For automatic scanning simply tap the Scan button. Bambu Lab printers that are on the same WiFi network will be displayed in the scan results with the Name , Printer IP , SN and Model information pre-populated. Pre-populating these fields helps to make adding printers easier and can result in fewer mistakes due to manual data input errors. The only data that you will need to enter is the Access Code which can be found within the printer WiFi/LAN menu. Instructions on how to find your access code will be displayed on the Panda Touch screen. Printers which have previously been connected to the Panda Touch will still be displayed in the scan results however the Panda Touch will not allow them to be added again and Already added will be displayed near to the printer icon. Once you have entered your access code you can confirm the connection or manually add some of the data below. Manual Data Entry \u00b6 You can click on the printer icon on the left to enter the menu for selecting the printer model. You must set it according to the actual model of the printer you are connecting to. The Panda Touch will also perform some checks in the background to confirm the model. The available models are as follows: P1P P1S X1C A1 mini A1 After selecting a model using the icon, the content in the Model field will be filled with the corresponding model name. After selecting the printer model, there are 4 required fields. These fields contain information necessary to connect to and identify the printer.

The upper left corner of the title bar will display the number of the printers that have sent HMS notifications. Click on the corresponding HMS notification to pop up the wiki link QR code for troubleshooting this problem. Click X to ignore this notification. Click Ignore All to ignore all notifications. Note: the Panda Touch will ignore notifications from all printers but the X1C. Since the X1C repeatedly sends notification information at regular intervals, ignored notifications may reappear shortly thereafter. Firmware \u00b6 Firmware History \u00b6 Note\uff1a Updating versions V1.0.2 and above requires sending two files to Panda Touch. One is the firmware file and the other contains the graphics and fonts. This will help us to add more languages to the Panda touch in the future. Be sure to download both the .bin and .img files. V1.0.4 \u00b6 Added the ability to log in to the Bambu account on the settings page, supporting the addition of printers to enable cloud mode. This resolves the issue of not being able to initiate printing and heating functions on Bambu P-series printers using the latest firmware via PandaTouch. Added the ability to switch locally added printers to cloud mode in PandaTouch. Added WiFi automatic reconnection feature, which supports automatic connection to the strongest WiFi signal within the same SSID. This resolves the issue of not being able to automatically connect to the strongest same-name WiFi in Mesh networks. Added the ability to sort print files stored on the printer's SD card and external USB drives connected to PandaTouch from newest to oldest. How to add a account \u00b6 Click to jump to the settings page, then click the \"login BambuLab account\" button. Users in China use mobile phone numbers, while users in global regions use email addresses. Tap the confirm button. Synchronize the printers under the account to the local device \u00b6 After successful login, you can choose to synchronize the printers under your account to the local device. Tap \"Yes\" to synchronize,during this process, the synchronized printers must be on the same network as PandaTouch. In case of poor network connection, you may need to re-edit the printer's IP address. As we can see, this printer works in cloud mode. How to delete a account \u00b6 Click the \"X\" button in the upper right corner of the account information to delete the account information saved on PandaTouch. After deleting the account information, the communication mode between PandaTouch and the printer will be changed to local mode. This operation will not directly switch the working mode of the printer itself. How to change working mode between PandaTouch and printer \u00b6 Synchronize the printers under the account to switch communication methods locally by selecting cloud mode. Before switching to cloud mode, a new account needs to be added. V1.0.3 \u00b6 Add Multi-group feature. Add the ability to change picture of Panda. Add auto select external filament slot with no AMS. Add the feature when operating the axis during a print, a prompt pops up indicating that the operation is not allowed. Add self healing IP address. Add ability to control screen brightness. Add the feature when adding a new printer, the number of scanning printers increases from 10 to 20. Add reprint function, only supports printing tasks launched from Panda touch, will not take action after restarting. Fix unable to load/unload when print is paused. Fix german filenames are now displayed correctly, \u00e4 \u00fc \u00f6 \u00df characters are displayed. Fix wiFi connection instability. If WiFi falls off the network the Panda Touch will attempt three forced disconnect-reconnect cycles. If these still fail then the user is alerted and given an option for a manual reboot. Fix use BSSID as the primary key for WiFi connections instead of SSID. Grouping logic \u00b6 Allow you to create up to 10 new groups to control multiple printers: How to add a group \u00b6 Tap + in the connected printer list to pop up the multi function menu. Choose the add group option. Choose the printer which you want add to the group. Tap the next and input the group name and click \"OK\". You now can see the group in the printer list, tapping this group will allow you to control the whole group but the controls presented will be those of the group leader. Switch to group \u00b6 To control an individual printer, simply click on the card that corresponds to it and you will be taken to the control page that sends commands to it in isolation even if it is part of a group. If you send a command that takes some time and then you send a command to a group that it belongs to, the second command will be ignored if the first is still busy. Start printing with one printer \u00b6 Tap to choose the file in the USB disk list to print. Set printing parameters: * Bed Leveling * Flow Calibration ( P1P and P1S do not have this feature, so these models of printers will not display this option.) * Timelapse * Use AMS (Panda Touch will automatically identify whether this printer has AMS plugged in and then determine whether this option needs to be displayed.) Automatically jump to the main interface and display printer data. Multiple printing \u00b6 Tap to choose the file in the USB disk list to print. Set printing parameters: * Bed Leveling * Flow Calibration (When there is a printer in the group that supports this feature, it will be automatically selected and only applicable to those supported printers.) * Timelapse * Use AMS (When there is a printer in the group that supports this feature, it will be automatically selected and only applicable to those supported printers.) Panda Touch will generate a list of available printers for you choose from. Printers that are already busy will be excluded from this list. This applies to groups that contain printers that are already busy too. Tick box print options for a particular group will be based on the functionality available for the most functional machine in the group. For example, you are using a group wich contains X1C\\P1P\\P1S, you will have the lidar scan option available but this option will only be sent to the printers in the group that support it. The group controls menu same as the version V1.0.1 How to exchange Panda Picture \u00b6 You can check out the tool form this link exchange picture tool Please upgrade the PandaTouch firmware to V1.0.3 before proceeding. The operation to replace the Panda image can only be performed on a Windows system. Please ensure that the image you want to replace meets the following requirements: pixel width less than 280, pixel height less than 306, pixel depth 32-bit color, and image format PNG. Step by Step \u00b6 The tool can run at windows system only. Download the Panda Exchange Tool from the firmware folder of V1.0.3. Ensure that the image you want to replace meets the format requirements, rename it, and replace the new_panda.png file in this folder. The Panda Exchange Tool folder already contains a new Panda image. If you don't have a specific image to replace, you can skip this step. Click generate_img.bat to compile. Enter the IP address of the Panda Touch in the browser to access the OTA web UI. Click \"Update File,\" select new_panda.img, and proceed with the update. V1.0.2 \u00b6 Add multi-language option, support chinese. V1.0.1 \u00b6 First released factory firmware. Grouping logic \u00b6 the Panda Touch has 4 settable control modes: Master : A single machine that acts as the source of instructions for itself and possibly other machines. The temperature, filament, and file list in the MicroSD Card displayed by Panda Touch are all derived from this printer. Panda Touch requires that a single printer is set at the Master as the source of this information. All controls on Temperature/Axis and Filament menus are in reference to the Master . The Panda Touch will monitor all print error and HMS messages from the Master in the background and either send them to the notification center if they are non-critical or display them with a pop-up if they are critical. You can start print jobs directly on the master using its internal SD memory. Slave : Slave machines will follow the instructions that the user sends to the Master . For example, instructions such as home , heating , setting filament information and load/unload filament will be followed by all slave machines. This design is for batch control of printers in print farms, so it is recommended that the model and filament (AMS) of Slave machines are the same as those of Master . If they are different, please use Slave mode with caution. All controls on Temperature/Axis and Filament menus will take effect on Slave machines. There can be none or multiple Slave machines at the same time. The Panda Touch will monitor all print error and HMS messages from the Slave machines in the background and either send them to the notification center if they are non-critical or display them with a pop-up if they are critical. You can start a print job on a Slave printer using an external USB drive and selecting the slave printer. Sync : An independent machine that does not follow the instructions sent to the master and slave machines. There can be none or multiple Sync machines at the same time. The Panda Touch will monitor all print error and HMS messages from the Sync machines in the background and either send them to the notification center if they are non-critical or display them with a pop-up if they are critical. You can start a print job on a Sync printer using an external USB drive and selecting the slave printer. you cannot control sync printers using the Temperature/Axis and Filament menus. They must be temporarily set to Master in order to do this. In a future firmware version the grouping scheme will be adjusted such that this is possible. Disconnected : The Panda Touch will close the connection to any printers in this state and no instructions will be sent to it. Start printing \u00b6 Start printing from USB flash drive \u00b6 Ensure that the file system of the USB flash drive is formatted as FAT32 . Export the .3mf file from either Bambu Studio or Orca Slicer using the Export plate sliced file option. Write the sliced .3mf file to the root directory of the USB flash drive Panda Touch only supports files are sliced in Build Plate #1 in Bambu Studio. Panda Touch only supports .3mf files and does not support .gcode files. Panda Touch only supports reading files in the root directory and does not support reading files in folders. Insert the USB flash drive into the Panda Touch, and then go to the USB flash drive menu. Find the file we want to print in the file list, click on the file name to select the printer(s) and start printing. \u2460: Select or deselect this printer to start the print job. \u2461: Set printing parameters: Bed Leveling Flow Calibration ( P1P and P1S do not have this feature, so these models of printers will not display this option.) Timelapse Use AMS (Panda Touch will automatically identify whether this printer has AMS plugged in and then determine whether this option needs to be displayed.) \u2462\uff1aList of printers selected to start the task. \u2463\uff1aStart printing. Please make sure that the sliced .3mf file is compatible with the selected printers. If using an AMS, please make sure that the filaments in the AMS tray are consistent with those in the sliced .3mf file as there is no ability to dynamically map filaments at the start of the print. Panda Touch will start to upload the files in the USB flash drive to the root directory of the printer's MicroSD card. Please make sure there is an MicroSD card inserted into the printer. Please ensure that the remaining capacity of the MicroSD card is sufficient to write the files to be uploaded. Printing will begin once the upload is complete. For very large .3mf files the transfer time may take some minutes to each printer. Start printing from the printer's MicroSD card \u00b6 Make sure the MicroSD card is inserted into the Master printer and formatted as FAT32 . Go to the Master printer's MicroSD card menu. Panda Touch only supports files are sliced in Build Plate #1 in Bambu Studio. Panda Touch only supports .3mf files and does not support .gcode files. Panda Touch only supports reading files in the root directory and does not support reading files in folders. The file list displayed in this menu is from the Master printer. If we want to print files from another printer, we can set the printer we want to print to as the Master . Just like the steps in Start printing from USB flash drive , select the printer to start printing. Multiple printing \u00b6 When a printer in the sync state is printing, or multiple printers in other states are printing at the same time, the Panda Touch will display the Multiple printing menu as shown below. The following group controls exist from this menu: \u2460: Turn ON/OFF the chamber LED of the printer in the current print list. \u2461: Stop all print jobs in the current print list. \u2462: Pause/Resume all print jobs in the current print list.

Troubleshooting \u00b6 Connection Troubleshooting \u00b6 Connect failed \u00b6 This prompt means that the Panda Touch cannot establish a connection with the printer. There are generally several which can cause this: The printer and Panda Touch are not on the same LAN - Check if the WiFi connected to the printer and Panda Touch is the same SSID. If not, connect them to the same SSID. The router restricts communication between devices within the LAN - This is usually the case when using the \"guest\" network of a wireless router. It is recommended to the devices to a normal WiFi network instead of a guest WiFi network. Incorrect printer IP address - The incorrect IP address was typed into the Panda Touch or the IP address of the printer has been changed by the router. Check that the IP address within the Panda Touch matches that of the printer. In a future firmware update, the Panda Touch will be able to automatically find and heal connections that have been broken due to the router changing the IP address of the printer. Incorrect printer SN code - An incorrect SN code was entered. Check that the SN of the printer matches that within the Panda Touch. Weak WiFi signal - Both the Panda Touch and printer have icons displaying WiFi signals, please try to ensure as strong a WiFi signal as possible. Authentication failed \u00b6 This prompt means that Panda Touch can establish a connection with the printer but authentication has failed. This is usually caused by an incorrect access code. Please check whether the printer's access code matches the set one. An incorrect access code are usually caused by the following: Input error. Clicking the refresh access code button on the printer resulting in the code changing. Enabling / Disabling the printer's LAN mode resulted in the printer generating a new access code. Exiting or logging back into the Bambu Lab account resulted in the printer generating a new access code. Technical Support \u00b6 Did this page help you?

Bigtreetech will monitor all beta firmware versions and if we find a firmware version that affects Panda Touch functionality we will send out an alert via email, Aliexpress chat and our social channels. Buyers can then decide whether or not they would like to perform the update at the risk of losing functionality. Note that the Panda Touch warranty does not cover lost functionality due to a Bambu Lab firmware update being performed. IMPORTANT USAGE INFORMATION \u00b6 When using \"LAN Only\" mode, firmware versions below V1.05.01.00 on the P1P/S will only allow either the Panda Touch or Bambu Studio to connect to the printer at one time. Firmware versions above that will allow both connections simultaneously. When using \"Cloud\" mode, firmware versions below V1.05.01.00 on the P1P/S will allow both Bambu Studio and the Panda Touch to connect simultaneously. However, they will not allow a third device such as Home Assistant to connect. Firmware versions above that will allow all three simultaneous connections. Please check the firmware listing in the product page description to ensure that your printer firmware is compatible with the Panda Touch. Updating printer firmware to an incompatible version that may limit the functionality of the Panda Touch is not covered under the Warranty. MicroSD card and USB drive files can currently only be read from the root directory and will only be recognized when models are sliced in Build Plate #1 in Bambu Studio and are in 3mf format. When running on its built-in lithium battery, the Panda Touch has a battery life of 30 minutes. To maintain the battery and extend the lifespan of the product, it is advised to charge the Panda Touch or turn it off as soon as the battery runs out. The screen may flicker when the lithium battery is low on power. This flickering is normal and acts as a warning to users that the battery is almost empty. Users should then promptly charge the battery or turn off the Panda Touch. If you plan to turn your printer on and off frequently then we recommend running the Panda Touch on USB direct mode. This bypasses the battery and prevents the battery from being taken through many charge-discharge cycles. If you want to run off the battery then simply flick the switch on the back of the Panda Touch to the battery power mode.

Packing list \u00b6 Panda Touch x 1 Mounting Bracket x 1 Magnetic Charging Dock x 1 USB-C Charging Cable x 1 M3x6 Screws x 4 Hex Key x 1 BTT Duck x 1 Installing Panda Touch \u00b6 Use the hex/allen key and the two M3x6 FHCS to assemble the Charging Dock and the Mounting Bracket as shown. Peel off the film from the bottom side of the Mounting Bracket. Ensure the printer surface is clean and free of oil, grease, etc., attach the assembled Charging Dock centrally atop the original screen. Apply pressure to adhere fully and allow 12 hours for optimal adhesion. Attach the Panda Touch to the Charging Dock. Wiring and Power Connection \u00b6 Remove the foam covering the USB port on the printer to access the port. Thread the Charging Cable through the hole on the right side of the printer, then plug the USB-C end into the power input of the Charging Dock. Insert the USB-A end of the charging cable into the USB port on the printer to connect the power supply. Then arrange the cable in the clip as shown. You have three options on the rear power switch. In the OFF position, the battery will charge but the Panda Touch will not be powered up. When switched to the battery position, the USB will charge the battery and power the Panda Touch at the same time. If the Panda Touch is removed from the dock then the battery will take over and power it for up to 30 minutes. Upon being returned to the dock, the USB will once again resume charging and powering the Panda Touch. This mode is recommended for users who do not turn their printer on and off often. Note that there is no battery charge level indicator. The Panda Touch has been designed for brief periods of use away from a dock and not for prolonged mobile use. When switched to the DC 5V position, the Panda Touch is powered directly from the USB input, while still charging the battery. Removing it from the dock will power it off without the Panda Touch draining the battery. This mode is recommended for users who often turn their printer on and off as it will preserve battery charge cycles. If such users wish to use the Panda Touch in a portable mode then they can flip the switch to battery power after removing it from the dock. Panda Touch has been successfully installed and powered on. Please follow the on-screen instructions for the next setup step. User Interface Instructions \u00b6 First time connection guide \u00b6 You will be presented with the screen below after booting for the first time or after executing the Restore Factory Settings command. Language select guide \u00b6 Choose a language for Panda Touch WiFi connection guide \u00b6 During the initial setup the Panda Touch will scan for WiFi networks and then display upt to 20 networks with the best signal strength. If you cannot find your desired network in the list then tap Refresh and the Panda Touch will rescan for WiFi networks. Note: Currently version of the firmware does not support connecting to hidden WiFi networks. Also, when Panda Touch is connecting to WiFi, Panda Touch cannot perform the WiFi scanning task at the same time. Click on the WiFi name in the list, and the keyboard interface will pop up. After entering the correct password, click \"OK\" to start connecting to WiFi. (Password length: 8~64 characters) The connection status will be displayed next to the name of the WiFi network.

Click Next to enter the printer connection menu. Printer connection menu \u00b6 There are two possible methods to connect the Panda Touch to a printer. Automatic Scanning (recommended). Manual data entry. Automatic Scanning \u00b6 For automatic scanning simply tap the Scan button. Bambu Lab printers that are on the same WiFi network will be displayed in the scan results with the Name , Printer IP , SN and Model information pre-populated. Pre-populating these fields helps to make adding printers easier and can result in fewer mistakes due to manual data input errors. The only data that you will need to enter is the Access Code which can be found within the printer WiFi/LAN menu. Instructions on how to find your access code will be displayed on the Panda Touch screen. Printers which have previously been connected to the Panda Touch will still be displayed in the scan results however the Panda Touch will not allow them to be added again and Already added will be displayed near to the printer icon. Once you have entered your access code you can confirm the connection or manually add some of the data below. Manual Data Entry \u00b6 You can click on the printer icon on the left to enter the menu for selecting the printer model. You must set it according to the actual model of the printer you are connecting to. The Panda Touch will also perform some checks in the background to confirm the model.

Fix german filenames are now displayed correctly, \u00e4 \u00fc \u00f6 \u00df characters are displayed. Fix wiFi connection instability. If WiFi falls off the network the Panda Touch will attempt three forced disconnect-reconnect cycles. If these still fail then the user is alerted and given an option for a manual reboot. Fix use BSSID as the primary key for WiFi connections instead of SSID. Grouping logic \u00b6 Allow you to create up to 10 new groups to control multiple printers: How to add a group \u00b6 Tap + in the connected printer list to pop up the multi function menu. Choose the add group option. Choose the printer which you want add to the group. Tap the next and input the group name and click \"OK\". You now can see the group in the printer list, tapping this group will allow you to control the whole group but the controls presented will be those of the group leader. Switch to group \u00b6 To control an individual printer, simply click on the card that corresponds to it and you will be taken to the control page that sends commands to it in isolation even if it is part of a group. If you send a command that takes some time and then you send a command to a group that it belongs to, the second command will be ignored if the first is still busy. Start printing with one printer \u00b6 Tap to choose the file in the USB disk list to print. Set printing parameters: * Bed Leveling * Flow Calibration ( P1P and P1S do not have this feature, so these models of printers will not display this option.) * Timelapse * Use AMS (Panda Touch will automatically identify whether this printer has AMS plugged in and then determine whether this option needs to be displayed.) Automatically jump to the main interface and display printer data. Multiple printing \u00b6 Tap to choose the file in the USB disk list to print. Set printing parameters: * Bed Leveling * Flow Calibration (When there is a printer in the group that supports this feature, it will be automatically selected and only applicable to those supported printers.) * Timelapse * Use AMS (When there is a printer in the group that supports this feature, it will be automatically selected and only applicable to those supported printers.) Panda Touch will generate a list of available printers for you choose from. Printers that are already busy will be excluded from this list. This applies to groups that contain printers that are already busy too. Tick box print options for a particular group will be based on the functionality available for the most functional machine in the group. For example, you are using a group wich contains X1C\\P1P\\P1S, you will have the lidar scan option available but this option will only be sent to the printers in the group that support it. The group controls menu same as the version V1.0.1 How to exchange Panda Picture \u00b6 You can check out the tool form this link exchange picture tool Please upgrade the PandaTouch firmware to V1.0.3 before proceeding. The operation to replace the Panda image can only be performed on a Windows system. Please ensure that the image you want to replace meets the following requirements: pixel width less than 280, pixel height less than 306, pixel depth 32-bit color, and image format PNG. Step by Step \u00b6 The tool can run at windows system only. Download the Panda Exchange Tool from the firmware folder of V1.0.3. Ensure that the image you want to replace meets the format requirements, rename it, and replace the new_panda.png file in this folder. The Panda Exchange Tool folder already contains a new Panda image. If you don't have a specific image to replace, you can skip this step. Click generate_img.bat to compile. Enter the IP address of the Panda Touch in the browser to access the OTA web UI. Click \"Update File,\" select new_panda.img, and proceed with the update. V1.0.2 \u00b6 Add multi-language option, support chinese. V1.0.1 \u00b6 First released factory firmware. Grouping logic \u00b6 the Panda Touch has 4 settable control modes: Master : A single machine that acts as the source of instructions for itself and possibly other machines. The temperature, filament, and file list in the MicroSD Card displayed by Panda Touch are all derived from this printer. Panda Touch requires that a single printer is set at the Master as the source of this information. All controls on Temperature/Axis and Filament menus are in reference to the Master . The Panda Touch will monitor all print error and HMS messages from the Master in the background and either send them to the notification center if they are non-critical or display them with a pop-up if they are critical. You can start print jobs directly on the master using its internal SD memory. Slave : Slave machines will follow the instructions that the user sends to the Master . For example, instructions such as home , heating , setting filament information and load/unload filament will be followed by all slave machines. This design is for batch control of printers in print farms, so it is recommended that the model and filament (AMS) of Slave machines are the same as those of Master . If they are different, please use Slave mode with caution. All controls on Temperature/Axis and Filament menus will take effect on Slave machines. There can be none or multiple Slave machines at the same time. The Panda Touch will monitor all print error and HMS messages from the Slave machines in the background and either send them to the notification center if they are non-critical or display them with a pop-up if they are critical. You can start a print job on a Slave printer using an external USB drive and selecting the slave printer. Sync : An independent machine that does not follow the instructions sent to the master and slave machines. There can be none or multiple Sync machines at the same time. The Panda Touch will monitor all print error and HMS messages from the Sync machines in the background and either send them to the notification center if they are non-critical or display them with a pop-up if they are critical. You can start a print job on a Sync printer using an external USB drive and selecting the slave printer. you cannot control sync printers using the Temperature/Axis and Filament menus. They must be temporarily set to Master in order to do this. In a future firmware version the grouping scheme will be adjusted such that this is possible. Disconnected : The Panda Touch will close the connection to any printers in this state and no instructions will be sent to it. Start printing \u00b6 Start printing from USB flash drive \u00b6 Ensure that the file system of the USB flash drive is formatted as FAT32 . Export the .3mf file from either Bambu Studio or Orca Slicer using the Export plate sliced file option. Write the sliced .3mf file to the root directory of the USB flash drive Panda Touch only supports files are sliced in Build Plate #1 in Bambu Studio. Panda Touch only supports .3mf files and does not support .gcode files. Panda Touch only supports reading files in the root directory and does not support reading files in folders. Insert the USB flash drive into the Panda Touch, and then go to the USB flash drive menu. Find the file we want to print in the file list, click on the file name to select the printer(s) and start printing. \u2460: Select or deselect this printer to start the print job. \u2461: Set printing parameters: Bed Leveling Flow Calibration ( P1P and P1S do not have this feature, so these models of printers will not display this option.) Timelapse Use AMS (Panda Touch will automatically identify whether this printer has AMS plugged in and then determine whether this option needs to be displayed.) \u2462\uff1aList of printers selected to start the task. \u2463\uff1aStart printing. Please make sure that the sliced .3mf file is compatible with the selected printers. If using an AMS, please make sure that the filaments in the AMS tray are consistent with those in the sliced .3mf file as there is no ability to dynamically map filaments at the start of the print. Panda Touch will start to upload the files in the USB flash drive to the root directory of the printer's MicroSD card. Please make sure there is an MicroSD card inserted into the printer. Please ensure that the remaining capacity of the MicroSD card is sufficient to write the files to be uploaded. Printing will begin once the upload is complete. For very large .3mf files the transfer time may take some minutes to each printer. Start printing from the printer's MicroSD card \u00b6 Make sure the MicroSD card is inserted into the Master printer and formatted as FAT32 . Go to the Master printer's MicroSD card menu. Panda Touch only supports files are sliced in Build Plate #1 in Bambu Studio. Panda Touch only supports .3mf files and does not support .gcode files. Panda Touch only supports reading files in the root directory and does not support reading files in folders. The file list displayed in this menu is from the Master printer. If we want to print files from another printer, we can set the printer we want to print to as the Master . Just like the steps in Start printing from USB flash drive , select the printer to start printing. Multiple printing \u00b6 When a printer in the sync state is printing, or multiple printers in other states are printing at the same time, the Panda Touch will display the Multiple printing menu as shown below. The following group controls exist from this menu: \u2460: Turn ON/OFF the chamber LED of the printer in the current print list. \u2461: Stop all print jobs in the current print list. \u2462: Pause/Resume all print jobs in the current print list.

Enter the SN code into the corresponding Panda Touch input boxes. Troubleshooting \u00b6 Connection Troubleshooting \u00b6 Connect failed \u00b6 This prompt means that the Panda Touch cannot establish a connection with the printer. There are generally several which can cause this: The printer and Panda Touch are not on the same LAN - Check if the WiFi connected to the printer and Panda Touch is the same SSID. If not, connect them to the same SSID. The router restricts communication between devices within the LAN - This is usually the case when using the \"guest\" network of a wireless router. It is recommended to the devices to a normal WiFi network instead of a guest WiFi network. Incorrect printer IP address - The incorrect IP address was typed into the Panda Touch or the IP address of the printer has been changed by the router. Check that the IP address within the Panda Touch matches that of the printer. In a future firmware update, the Panda Touch will be able to automatically find and heal connections that have been broken due to the router changing the IP address of the printer. Incorrect printer SN code - An incorrect SN code was entered. Check that the SN of the printer matches that within the Panda Touch. Weak WiFi signal - Both the Panda Touch and printer have icons displaying WiFi signals, please try to ensure as strong a WiFi signal as possible. Authentication failed \u00b6 This prompt means that Panda Touch can establish a connection with the printer but authentication has failed. This is usually caused by an incorrect access code. Please check whether the printer's access code matches the set one. An incorrect access code are usually caused by the following: Input error. Clicking the refresh access code button on the printer resulting in the code changing. Enabling / Disabling the printer's LAN mode resulted in the printer generating a new access code. Exiting or logging back into the Bambu Lab account resulted in the printer generating a new access code. Technical Support \u00b6 Did this page help you?

Firmware versions above that will allow both connections simultaneously. When using \"Cloud\" mode, firmware versions below V1.05.01.00 on the P1P/S will allow both Bambu Studio and the Panda Touch to connect simultaneously. However, they will not allow a third device such as Home Assistant to connect. Firmware versions above that will allow all three simultaneous connections. Please check the firmware listing in the product page description to ensure that your printer firmware is compatible with the Panda Touch. Updating printer firmware to an incompatible version that may limit the functionality of the Panda Touch is not covered under the Warranty. MicroSD card and USB drive files can currently only be read from the root directory and will only be recognized when models are sliced in Build Plate #1 in Bambu Studio and are in 3mf format. When running on its built-in lithium battery, the Panda Touch has a battery life of 30 minutes. To maintain the battery and extend the lifespan of the product, it is advised to charge the Panda Touch or turn it off as soon as the battery runs out. The screen may flicker when the lithium battery is low on power. This flickering is normal and acts as a warning to users that the battery is almost empty. Users should then promptly charge the battery or turn off the Panda Touch. If you plan to turn your printer on and off frequently then we recommend running the Panda Touch on USB direct mode. This bypasses the battery and prevents the battery from being taken through many charge-discharge cycles. If you want to run off the battery then simply flick the switch on the back of the Panda Touch to the battery power mode.","title":"IMPORTANT USAGE INFORMATION"},{"location":"locales/en/PandaTouch.html#specifications","text":"MCU Xtensa 32-bit LX7 dual-core ESP32S3R8 up to 240MHz clock speed.

The temperature, filament, and file list in the MicroSD Card displayed by Panda Touch are all derived from this printer. Panda Touch requires that a single printer is set at the Master as the source of this information. All controls on Temperature/Axis and Filament menus are in reference to the Master . The Panda Touch will monitor all print error and HMS messages from the Master in the background and either send them to the notification center if they are non-critical or display them with a pop-up if they are critical. You can start print jobs directly on the master using its internal SD memory. Slave : Slave machines will follow the instructions that the user sends to the Master . For example, instructions such as home , heating , setting filament information and load/unload filament will be followed by all slave machines. This design is for batch control of printers in print farms, so it is recommended that the model and filament (AMS) of Slave machines are the same as those of Master . If they are different, please use Slave mode with caution. All controls on Temperature/Axis and Filament menus will take effect on Slave machines. There can be none or multiple Slave machines at the same time. The Panda Touch will monitor all print error and HMS messages from the Slave machines in the background and either send them to the notification center if they are non-critical or display them with a pop-up if they are critical. You can start a print job on a Slave printer using an external USB drive and selecting the slave printer. Sync : An independent machine that does not follow the instructions sent to the master and slave machines. There can be none or multiple Sync machines at the same time. The Panda Touch will monitor all print error and HMS messages from the Sync machines in the background and either send them to the notification center if they are non-critical or display them with a pop-up if they are critical.

Be careful not to select the wrong storage device, otherwise the data will be formatted). 5\u3001Wait for the process to complete. Writing System onto eMMC \u00b6 Using RKDevTool to Write the eMMC (Windows) \u00b6 Download and unzip RKDevTool from the GitHub repository ( https://github.com/bigtreetech/CB2 ) to your computer. DO NOT insert aMicroSD card. 1\u3001As shown in the diagram below, toggle the USB OTG switch to the ON position. At this position, the USB OTG port is connected to a Type-C port. Set the eMMC switch to the OFF position, allowing the RK3566 to access the eMMC normally. 2\u3001Hold down the \u201cRecovery\u201d button, then connect the BIGTREETECH Pi 2 tothe computer using a Type-C cable. Power on and after 3 seconds, release the button. 3\u3001 Install the driver: \u2460 In \u201cDevice Manager\u201d, if you see \u201cUnknown Device\u201d, it indicates that the computer is missing drivers. \u2461 Open the DriverAssistant tool in the downloaded RKDevTool folder, click \u201c\u2460 Uninstall Driver\u201d, then click \u201c\u2461 Install Driver\u201d to ensure that the latest version of the driver is installed. \u2462 After the installation is complete, hold down the \u201cRecovery\u201d button, replug the Type-C cable. \"Device Manager\" should now recognize a \u201cRockusb Device\u201d, indicating that the driver installation is successful. 4\u3001Open the \u201cRKDevTool\u201d software\uff1a Note: The parameters in the software are set by default as shown in the image. Normally, you only need to set the \u201c\u2463 actual path of the .img system\u201d. If the parameters in your software do not match those in the image, manually adjust them to match. \u2460 Find the path where the downloaded RKDevTool is located. \u2461 Open the RKDevTool tool. \u2462 The software will recognize a \u201cLOADER\u201d or \u201cMASKROOM\u201d device. \u2463 Select the system to be written (the OS image must be unzipped as a .img file beforehand; RKDevTool does not support directly writing compressed .xz files). \u2464 Check \u201cWrite by Address\u201d. \u2465 Click \u201cRun\u201d to start writting the system. \u2466 \u201cDownload image OK\u201d indicates that the system has been successfully burned. 5\u3001After writing is complete, toggle the USB OTG switch to the OFF position to boot normally. Note: Files on the eMMC cannot be accessed by the computer like those on a MicroSD card, so you cannot modify the system.cfg configuration file to set up the WiFi network. Instead, use an Ethernet cable or USB-to-UART connection to configure the terminal. Writing System onto eMMC Using a MicroSD Card \u00b6 As shown in the figure, toggle the eMMC switch to the OFF position so that the RK3566 can access the eMMC normally. First, write the system onto a MicroSD card, then insert the MicroSD card into the board's card slot, and wait for the system to boot. Connect to the system's terminal via Ethernet, WiFi, or USB to UART. Log in with the following credentials: login: biqu password: biqu Execute the command sudo nand-sata-install. In the interface that pops up, select \"2 Boot From eMMC - system on eMMC\" and then select \"OK\" \u2460 Select \"Yes\" to start erasing and writing the system onto the eMMC. \u2461 Choose the filesystem \"1 ext4\" and then select \"OK\". \u2462 Wait for the writing process to complete. \u2463 Upon completion, you will be prompted whether to power off. Select \u201cPower off\u201d to shut down the system. \u2464 After the system has powered down, disconnect the power supply, remove the MicroSD card, and then reconnect power. The system should now boot from the eMMC. Erasing eMMC \u00b6 When using a MicroSD card as the system card instead, it's best to erase the data on the eMMC to prevent the motherboard from booting from it by mistake. Using RKDevTool to Erase eMMC (Windows) \u00b6 1\u3001Refer to the steps in \"4.3.1 Using RKDevTool to Write the eMMC (Windows)\" to connect the motherboard to the computer. 2\u3001Open the \"RKDevTool\". \u2460 Find the path where the downloaded RKDevTool is located. \u2461 Open the RKDevTool. \u2462 The software will recognize a \"LOADER\" device. If it recognizes \"MASKROOM,\" it indicates there is no data in the eMMC, hence no erase operation is necessary. \u2463 Click \"Advanced Function.\" \u2464 Click \"EraseAll\" to begin erasing data from the eMMC. \u2465 \"Erasing sectors success\" indicates the erasure is complete. Erasing eMMC After Booting from MicroSD Card \u00b6 1\u3001Refer to the steps in \"4.3.2 Writing System onto eMMC Using a MicroSD Card\" and log into the system terminal. 2\u3001Run the command sudo mkfs /dev/mmcblk1 and then enter \"y\" to confirm. System Configuration \u00b6 Using Ethernet \u00b6 Ethernet is plug-and-play and requires no additional setup. Setting Up WiFi \u00b6 After the system image has been written, the MicroSD card will have a FAT32 partition recognized by the computer. In this partition, there is a \"system.cfg\" file. Open it and replace \"Your SSID\" with your actual WiFi name and \"YourPassword\" with the actual password. Configuring Overlays \u00b6 Open the \"armbianEnv.txt\" file in the BOOT partition and set the values for overlays. The configuration file supports only one line of overlays at a time; if multiple overlays are enabled, only the last line will take effect. If you need multiple overlays, place the contents of multiple configurations on the same line separated by a space. For example, if you need to use a DSI screen, MCP2515 SPI to CAN module, and I2C1 simultaneously: overlays=dsi mcp2515 i2c1 Configuring the Display \u00b6 1\u3001Open the \"armbianEnv.txt\" file in the BOOT partition. 2\u3001The default overlay is set to \"hdmi,\" meaning the system uses an HDMI screen by default. This can be changed to match the actual screen being used, such as: \u00b7 \"hdmi\": HDMI screen \u00b7 \"dsi\": DSI screen \u00b7 \"tft_35\": SPI Screen \u00b7 For \"tft_35\", there is also a \"tft35_spi_rotate\" parameter for system-level screen rotation, with default \"0\" meaning no rotation, other options include \"90\", \"180\", \"270\". Note: Only one screen type can be used at a time. 3\u3001To configure KlipperScreen, open the system.cfg file in the BOOT partition. Set the screen type with the parameter ks_src , and the rotation angle with ks_angle . Using SPI to CAN \u00b6 Open the \"armbianEnv.txt\" file in the BOOT partition and add \"mcp2515\" to the overlays configuration. Using CSI Camera and Crowsnest Configuration \u00b6 For both RPi v1.3 ov5647 and RPi v2 imx219 cameras, no specific configuration in \"armbianEnv.txt\" is required as they are plug-and-play. \"crowsnest.conf\" file configuration is as follows: device: /dev/video0 # The CSI camera node is fixed as video0 custom_flags: --format=UYVY # The current system's CSI camera does not support the default YUYV, so it needs to be set to the supported UYVY format. Using Bluetooth \u00b6 1\u3001 To scan for Bluetooth devices, enter the following command, and a list of Bluetooth devices will appear as shown below: bluetoothctl --timeout 15 scan on 2\u3001Find your Bluetooth device, for example, if your device name is \"HONOR xSport PRO\", locate the corresponding Bluetooth MAC ID as shown below. 3\u3001To connect to a Bluetooth device, enter the following command, connection success is shown as below bluetoothctl connect E0:9D:FA:50:CD:4F \u2460 If there's an issue while connecting, as shown below, please restart the Bluetooth device and repeat steps 1 and 2 to connect. \u2461 If there's an issue while connecting, as shown below, please enter the following commands and then repeat steps 1 and 2: bluetoothctl remove E0:9D:FA:50:CD:4F (Your Bluetooth device's corresponding MAC ID) rfkill block bluetooth sleep 3s rfkill unblock bluetooth pulseaudio -k pulseaudio \u2013start 4\u3001If you exit voice playback during the use of Bluetooth and cannot reuse it, manually delete the corresponding playback process. Use the ps command to view the process number, then use kill -9 process_number to delete the corresponding playback process. Setting up 3.5mm Headphones Port \u00b6 1\u3001Enter the command: aplay -l Check for the corresponding sound card, as shown in the image (the sound card for the headphone port shown in the image corresponds to card 0 ). 2\u3001Enter the command: amixer -c 0 contents (0 represents the card 0 found in the previous aplay -l command) Check the settings for playback and recording channels, as shown in the image. 3\u3001Enter the command: amixer -c 0 cset numid=1 3 Set the playback channel, as shown in the image. 4\u3001 Enter the command: amixer -c 0 cset numid=2 1 Set the recording channel, as shown in the image. 5\u3001Enter the following command to play audio, with the audio file directory xxx and the audio file name xxxxx.wav: aplay -D plughw:0,0 /xxx/xxxxx.wav 6\u3001Enter the following command to record (where 10 represents recording for 10 seconds), storing the recording in directory xxx, file name xxxx.wav: sudo arecord -Dhw:0,0 -d 10 -f cd -r 44100 -c 2 -t wav /xxx/xxxx.wav 7\u3001Enter the following command to play the recording: aplay -D plughw:0,0 /xxx/xxxx.wav SSH Connect to Device \u00b6 1\u3001Install the SSH software Mobaxterm: https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html 2\u3001After powering on, wait for the system to boot, which typically takes about 1 to 2 minutes. 3\u3001Once the device is connected to WiFi or an Ethernet cable is plugged in, it will automatically be assigned an IP address. 4\u3001Access the router management interface to find the device's IP (it should be BTT-CB2 here). 5\u3001Open Mobaxterm and click \"Session\", and click \"SSH\", inset the device IP into Remote host and click \"OK\" (Note: your computer and the device needs to be in the same network). 6\u3001Login as: biqu password: biqu Precautions \u00b6 1\u3001About 10 seconds after powering on, the system enters the kernel phase. At this time, the blue light stays on, and the green light flashes continuously, indicating that the system is running normally. 2\u3001Root administrator: \u200b Login: root \u200b Password: root \u200b BIQU user: \u200b Login: biqu \u200b Password: biqu 3\u3001The PCIe M.2 interface does not support hot-plugging; the solid-state drive must be connected in advance for the device to be recognized. 4\u3001When booting from eMMC, do not insert a MicroSD card.

Dimensions \u00b6 Peripheral Interface \u00b6 Interface Diagram \u00b6 Pin Description \u00b6 Interface Introduction \u00b6 USB Power Supply \u00b6 After the SKR 3 EZ V1.0 motherboard is powered on, the red light of D7 (Power) in the upper right corner of the MCU will light up, indicating that the power supply is normal. The VUSB in the middle of the board is the power selection terminal. Only when using USB to supply power to the motherboard or need to supply power through USB, you need to use the jumper to make the VUSB short circuit. Motor Voltage Selection \u00b6 Motherboard Power Voltage for Motor Voltage Selection \u00b6 Motor Supply Voltage for Motor Voltage Selection \u00b6 Step Motor Drivers \u00b6 TMC-driven Mode \u00b6 The number of subdivisions needs to be set high or low by firmware to the corresponding subdivision configuration pins. TMC/EZ-driven UART/SPI Mode \u00b6 TMC series drivers do not support the use of both UART and SPI drivers at the same time, for example: X, Y-axis use TMC/EZ2209 (UART), Z, E0 axis use TMC/EZ5160 (SPI). The EZ series drivers support the simultaneous use of both UART and SPI drivers. TMC-driven DIAG mode(Sensorless Homing) \u00b6 As shown in the pictures, plug the jumper cap when using the Sensorless Homing function, and leave it unplugged when not in use. There is no need to cut the DIAG pin of the driver. USB and CAN Mode \u00b6 As shown in the figure below, the double-pole double-throw switch is in USB mode when it is in the pop-up state, and in CAN FD mode when it is in the pressed state. Voltage selection for NC fans \u00b6 If DCIN is used as the power supply of the numerical control fan, a jumper cap should be used to short-circuit the two pins within the VIN range. If you want to use 12V or 5V as the NC fan power supply, you need to make a jumper cap shortcircuit two pins within the VOT range, and insert the SKR 3-DC MODE into the 2*4Pin VOT and VIN headers. Set the VOT output voltage to 5V or 12V by setting the jumper cap on the SKR 3-DC MODE. 100K NTC or PT1000 Setup \u00b6 When using a 100K NTC thermistor, no need to insert a jumper cap. At this time, the pull-up resistors of TH0 and TH1 are 4.7K. When using PT1000, you need to use jump caps to short-circuit the two pins in the red box in the picture below. At this time, the pull-up resistors of TH0 and TH1 are 2.2K Note: the temperature accuracy read out in this way will be much worse than that of MAX31865. BLTouch Connection \u00b6 Completed Shut-down Module(Relay V1.2) Connection \u00b6 Resume Printing(UPS 24V V1.0) Connection \u00b6 RGB Connection \u00b6 Break Detection Connection \u00b6 Touch Screen Connection \u00b6 Heater cartridge IO \u00b6 The IO of the SKR 3 heater cartridge is wired to the MOS by the jumper. You can remove the jumper and connect the IO to device directly if you need to use the laser or other device that need PWM. Note: The IO passes through logic conversion chip, the output high level is 5V, and cannot be used as an input.

Step 1: In the Marlin 2.0 firmware, locate and open the \"Configuration.h\" file, then find the line \"#define MOTHERBOARD XXXXXX\". \"XXXXXX\" represents the model of the board being used. Confirm the motherboard you are using. Step 2: In the Marlin\\src\\pins directory, find the \"pins_xxxxxx.h\" file corresponding to your board (xxxxxx represents the board model), and then locate \"X_CS_PIN\", \"Y_CS_PIN\", \"Z_CS_PIN\", and \"EO_CS_PIN\" within the file. Modify the pin names following these variables to the pins you are using. Step 3: In the file from Step 2, locate \"#define TMC_SW_MOSI XXX\", \"#define TMC_SW_MISO XXX\", and \"#define TMC_SW_SCK XXX\". Change \"XXX\" to the pins you want to use. Step 4: Find and open \"Configuration_adv.h\", then locate \"#define TMC_USE_SW_SPI\" and remove the comment symbols \"//\". Step 5: In the \"Configuration_adv.h\" file, find \"#define X_CURRENT\", \"#define X_MICROSTEPS\", and \"#define X_RSENSE\" and modify the parameters that follow (for each axis being used). The RSENSE value for each used axis should be changed to \"0.022\". Step 6: Set the corresponding axis drive type to \"TMC5160\" in the \"Configuration.h\" file. Klipper Firmware Settings \u00b6 Note: The default sense_resistor in Klipper is 0.075; it needs to be set to 0.022. Precautions \u00b6 Turn off the power before installing the driver to prevent damage. Do not plug or unplug the driver module with power on to avoid damage. Be cautious of polarity when connecting; reversing can cause the driver to burn out. The factory-installed heat sink should not be removed, as doing so will decrease heat dissipation in the absence of thermal interface material. For large currents (greater than 3A), active cooling is required for normal operation. This product uses a 0.022R sampling resistor, so the maximum effective driving current is 10.6A. Pay attention to the power sequence; ensure the driver power is turned on before the logic power. That is, turn on the driver power first, then power on the motherboard.

Firmware Setup \u00b6 Klipper \u00b6 Insert your fan port pin into the pin section below and copy it to your \u201cprinter.cfg\u201d file: [fan] pin: # Output pin controlling the fan. This parameter must be provided. max_power: 0.8 # This should be set to 0.8 on most motherboards to give full range of control to your slicer. # Anything above 80% duty cycle will be full power on this particular brushless driver. # To fine-tune the max_power parameter for your particular motherboard, set max_power to 1.0, go into the Klipper dashboard, and increase fan speed 1% at a time until the actual fan speed stops increasing as you increase the fan speed. Divide the fan speed at this point by 100 and enter it into the max_power parameter. # This parameter defines the maximum power (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the pin may be set to. # The value 1.0 allows the pin to be set fully enabled for extended periods, while a value of 0.5 would allow the pin to be enabled for no more than half the time. # This setting may be used to limit the total power output (over extended periods) to the fan. # If this value is less than 1.0, then fan speed requests will be scaled between zero and max_power (for example, if max_power is 0.9 and a fan speed of 80% is requested, then the fan power will be set to 72%). shutdown_speed: 0 # The desired fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) if # The microcontroller software enters an error state. # The default is 0. cycle_time: 0.005 # The amount of time (in seconds) for each PWM power cycle to the fan. # It is recommended this be 10 milliseconds or greater when using software-based PWM. # The default is 0.010 seconds. hardware_pwm: False # Enable this to use hardware PWM instead of software PWM. # Most fans do not work well with hardware PWM, so it is not recommended to enable this unless there is an electrical requirement to switch at very high speeds. # When using hardware PWM, the actual cycle time is constrained by the implementation and may be significantly different than the requested cycle_time. # The default is False. kick_start_time: 0.100 # Time (in seconds) to run the fan at full speed when either first enabling or increasing it by more than 50% (helps get the fan spinning). # The default is 0.100 seconds. off_below: 0.1 # The blower will not spin with the included brushless driver when the duty cycle is below 8%. When scaled with Max_power at 0.8, the off_below parameter should be set to 0.1. # To calibrate this setting, gradually lower the fan speed to determine the lowest input speed that reliably drives the fan without stalls. # Set off_below to the duty cycle corresponding to this value (for example, 8% -> 0.08/Max_power -> 0.08/0.8 -> 0.1) or slightly higher. # This parameter is the minimum input speed that will power the fan (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0). # When a speed lower than off_below is requested, the fan will instead be turned off. # This setting may be used to prevent fan stalls and to ensure effective kick starts. # To calibrate this setting, start with off_below set to 0.0 and the fan spinning. # Gradually lower the fan speed to determine the lowest input speed that reliably drives the fan without stalls. # Set off_below to the duty cycle corresponding to this value (for example, 12% -> 0.12) or slightly higher. #Tachometer_pin: # Tachometer input pin for monitoring fan speed. A pullup is generally required. # This parameter is optional. #Tachometer_ppr: 1 # When tachometer_pin is specified, this is the number of pulses per revolution of the tachometer signal. #Tachometer_poll_interval: 0.0005 # When tachometer_pin is specified, this is the polling period of the tachometer pin, in seconds. # The default is 0.0015, which is fast enough for fans below 10,000 RPM at 2 PPR. # This must be smaller than 30/(tachometer_ppr*rpm), with some margin, where rpm is the # maximum speed (in RPM) of the fan.

This is the recommended configuration as it completely encloses the blower, keeping the noise level to a minimum. For this configuration, you will need the following extra parts: 1x BIGTREETECH SFS V2.0 module 2.Voron-Exhaust-UTK-without-fan: modified Voron design V2.4 exhaust hood without a 60mm exhaust fan. This is the recommended configuration for non-SFS users as it completely encloses the blower, keeping the noise level to a minimum. For this configuration, no extra parts are needed. 3.Voron-Exhaust-UTK-SFS-with-fan: this is a redesigned version of the Voron exhaust hood with an integrated SFS V2.0 module and a 60mm exhaust fan. A powerful 60mm fan is needed to maintain negative pressure in the printer enclosure due to the CPAP blower position; bear in mind that this will produce a high noise level, as the blower isn\u2019t enclosed.

This parameter must be provided. max_power: 0.8 # This should be set to 0.8 on most motherboards to give full range of control to your slicer. # Anything above 80% duty cycle will be full power on this particular brushless driver. # To fine-tune the max_power parameter for your particular motherboard, set max_power to 1.0, go into the Klipper dashboard, and increase fan speed 1% at a time until the actual fan speed stops increasing as you increase the fan speed. Divide the fan speed at this point by 100 and enter it into the max_power parameter. # This parameter defines the maximum power (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the pin may be set to. # The value 1.0 allows the pin to be set fully enabled for extended periods, while a value of 0.5 would allow the pin to be enabled for no more than half the time. # This setting may be used to limit the total power output (over extended periods) to the fan. # If this value is less than 1.0, then fan speed requests will be scaled between zero and max_power (for example, if max_power is 0.9 and a fan speed of 80% is requested, then the fan power will be set to 72%). shutdown_speed: 0 # The desired fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) if # The microcontroller software enters an error state. # The default is 0. cycle_time: 0.005 # The amount of time (in seconds) for each PWM power cycle to the fan. # It is recommended this be 10 milliseconds or greater when using software-based PWM. # The default is 0.010 seconds. hardware_pwm: False # Enable this to use hardware PWM instead of software PWM. # Most fans do not work well with hardware PWM, so it is not recommended to enable this unless there is an electrical requirement to switch at very high speeds. # When using hardware PWM, the actual cycle time is constrained by the implementation and may be significantly different than the requested cycle_time. # The default is False. kick_start_time: 0.100 # Time (in seconds) to run the fan at full speed when either first enabling or increasing it by more than 50% (helps get the fan spinning). # The default is 0.100 seconds. off_below: 0.1 # The blower will not spin with the included brushless driver when the duty cycle is below 8%. When scaled with Max_power at 0.8, the off_below parameter should be set to 0.1. # To calibrate this setting, gradually lower the fan speed to determine the lowest input speed that reliably drives the fan without stalls. # Set off_below to the duty cycle corresponding to this value (for example, 8% -> 0.08/Max_power -> 0.08/0.8 -> 0.1) or slightly higher. # This parameter is the minimum input speed that will power the fan (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0). # When a speed lower than off_below is requested, the fan will instead be turned off. # This setting may be used to prevent fan stalls and to ensure effective kick starts. # To calibrate this setting, start with off_below set to 0.0 and the fan spinning. # Gradually lower the fan speed to determine the lowest input speed that reliably drives the fan without stalls. # Set off_below to the duty cycle corresponding to this value (for example, 12% -> 0.12) or slightly higher. #Tachometer_pin: # Tachometer input pin for monitoring fan speed.

controlling the fan. This parameter must be provided. max_power: 0.8 # This should be set to 0.8 on most motherboards to give full range of control to your slicer. # Anything above 80% duty cycle will be full power on this particular brushless driver. # To fine-tune the max_power parameter for your particular motherboard, set max_power to 1.0, go into the Klipper dashboard, and increase fan speed 1% at a time until the actual fan speed stops increasing as you increase the fan speed. Divide the fan speed at this point by 100 and enter it into the max_power parameter. # This parameter defines the maximum power (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the pin may be set to. # The value 1.0 allows the pin to be set fully enabled for extended periods, while a value of 0.5 would allow the pin to be enabled for no more than half the time. # This setting may be used to limit the total power output (over extended periods) to the fan. # If this value is less than 1.0, then fan speed requests will be scaled between zero and max_power (for example, if max_power is 0.9 and a fan speed of 80% is requested, then the fan power will be set to 72%). shutdown_speed: 0 # The desired fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) if # The microcontroller software enters an error state. # The default is 0. cycle_time: 0.005 # The amount of time (in seconds) for each PWM power cycle to the fan. # It is recommended this be 10 milliseconds or greater when using software-based PWM. # The default is 0.010 seconds. hardware_pwm: False # Enable this to use hardware PWM instead of software PWM. # Most fans do not work well with hardware PWM, so it is not recommended to enable this unless there is an electrical requirement to switch at very high speeds. # When using hardware PWM, the actual cycle time is constrained by the implementation and may be significantly different than the requested cycle_time. # The default is False. kick_start_time: 0.100 # Time (in seconds) to run the fan at full speed when either first enabling or increasing it by more than 50% (helps get the fan spinning). # The default is 0.100 seconds. off_below: 0.1 # The blower will not spin with the included brushless driver when the duty cycle is below 8%. When scaled with Max_power at 0.8, the off_below parameter should be set to 0.1. # To calibrate this setting, gradually lower the fan speed to determine the lowest input speed that reliably drives the fan without stalls. # Set off_below to the duty cycle corresponding to this value (for example, 8% -> 0.08/Max_power -> 0.08/0.8 -> 0.1) or slightly higher. # This parameter is the minimum input speed that will power the fan (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0). # When a speed lower than off_below is requested, the fan will instead be turned off. # This setting may be used to prevent fan stalls and to ensure effective kick starts. # To calibrate this setting, start with off_below set to 0.0 and the fan spinning. # Gradually lower the fan speed to determine the lowest input speed that reliably drives the fan without stalls. # Set off_below to the duty cycle corresponding to this value (for example, 12% -> 0.12) or slightly higher. #Tachometer_pin: # Tachometer input pin for monitoring fan speed. A pullup is generally required. # This parameter is optional. #Tachometer_ppr: 1 # When tachometer_pin is specified, this is the number of pulses per revolution of the tachometer signal. #Tachometer_poll_interval: 0.0005 # When tachometer_pin is specified, this is the polling period of the tachometer pin, in seconds. # The default is 0.0015, which is fast enough for fans below 10,000 RPM at 2 PPR. # This must be smaller than 30/(tachometer_ppr*rpm), with some margin, where rpm is the # maximum speed (in RPM) of the fan.

This parameter must be provided. max_power: 0.8 # This should be set to 0.8 on most motherboards to give full range of control to your slicer. # Anything above 80% duty cycle will be full power on this particular brushless driver. # To fine-tune the max_power parameter for your particular motherboard, set max_power to 1.0, go into the Klipper dashboard, and increase fan speed 1% at a time until the actual fan speed stops increasing as you increase the fan speed. Divide the fan speed at this point by 100 and enter it into the max_power parameter. # This parameter defines the maximum power (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the pin may be set to. # The value 1.0 allows the pin to be set fully enabled for extended periods, while a value of 0.5 would allow the pin to be enabled for no more than half the time. # This setting may be used to limit the total power output (over extended periods) to the fan. # If this value is less than 1.0, then fan speed requests will be scaled between zero and max_power (for example, if max_power is 0.9 and a fan speed of 80% is requested, then the fan power will be set to 72%). shutdown_speed: 0 # The desired fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) if # The microcontroller software enters an error state. # The default is 0. cycle_time: 0.005 # The amount of time (in seconds) for each PWM power cycle to the fan. # It is recommended this be 10 milliseconds or greater when using software-based PWM. # The default is 0.010 seconds. hardware_pwm: False # Enable this to use hardware PWM instead of software PWM. # Most fans do not work well with hardware PWM, so it is not recommended to enable this unless there is an electrical requirement to switch at very high speeds. # When using hardware PWM, the actual cycle time is constrained by the implementation and may be significantly different than the requested cycle_time. # The default is False. kick_start_time: 0.100 # Time (in seconds) to run the fan at full speed when either first enabling or increasing it by more than 50% (helps get the fan spinning). # The default is 0.100 seconds. off_below: 0.1 # The blower will not spin with the included brushless driver when the duty cycle is below 8%. When scaled with Max_power at 0.8, the off_below parameter should be set to 0.1. # To calibrate this setting, gradually lower the fan speed to determine the lowest input speed that reliably drives the fan without stalls. # Set off_below to the duty cycle corresponding to this value (for example, 8% -> 0.08/Max_power -> 0.08/0.8 -> 0.1) or slightly higher. # This parameter is the minimum input speed that will power the fan (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0). # When a speed lower than off_below is requested, the fan will instead be turned off. # This setting may be used to prevent fan stalls and to ensure effective kick starts. # To calibrate this setting, start with off_below set to 0.0 and the fan spinning. # Gradually lower the fan speed to determine the lowest input speed that reliably drives the fan without stalls. # Set off_below to the duty cycle corresponding to this value (for example, 12% -> 0.12) or slightly higher. #Tachometer_pin: # Tachometer input pin for monitoring fan speed.
