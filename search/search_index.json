Set WIFI_SSID as your actual wifi name and WIFI_PASSWD as your actual wifi password, The space character can be parsed normally without additional escape character. For example: WIFI_SSID=\"CB1 Tester\" Overlays Settings \u00b6 After the OS writes to the SD card, there is a FAT32 partition named BOOT , open BoardEnv.txt file with Notpad , Notpad++ or VSCode . Set as required as shown in the figure below. The default value is console=display , This means that the UART0 of CB1 is used as the debugging port by default. We can use MobaXterm to connect to CB1 by UART0 and debug. If klipper wants to use UART0 to control the motherboard, we need to set it to console=serial , now klippe can use UART0 as /dev/ttyS0 . CB1 will automatically identify the HDMI resolution, but if your HDMI screen cannot report the resolution through the EDID normally, we can forcibly specify the resolution of CB1 output by uncomment extraargs=video and set the actual resolution. For example: BTT-HDMI7 resolution = 1024x600: extraargs=video=HDMI-A-1:1024x600-24@60 BTT-HDMI5 resolution = 800x480: extraargs=video=HDMI-A-1:800x480-24@60 Uncomment overlays=tft35_spi to enable TFT35 SPI screen.

When using CAN communication, you need to see whether it is used as a terminal. If it is, you must plug a jumper cap on the 120R position. When DIY crimping, wire according to the silkscreen, and DIY according to the Pin and Schematic diagrams so as to avoid the power line from being reversely connected or connected to the CAN signal, which will get the module burned. If there's no external power supply during programming via USB port, you need to short the VUSB by jumper cap so as to supply the module with working voltage. The load current of the heater cartridge and the fan interfaces shall not exceed the maximum withstand current to prevent the MOS tube from being burned out. Please pay attention to the precautions in 4.2 Firmware Update to avoid keeping MCU in DFU mode for a long time when the main power supply and hotend are connected. FAQ \u00b6 Q: What's the maximum current for the heater cartridge and fan interface? A: The maximum output current of the heater cartridge interface: 5A. The maximum output current of the fan interface: 1A. The total current for the heater cartridge, driver and fan needs to be less than 9A. Q: Cannot update firmware via USB port? A: You need to make sure that the jump cap is plugged on VUSB, and the indicator light on the board is on.","title":"EBB Series"},{"location":"EBB%20Series.html#ebb-series","text":"","title":"EBB Series"},{"location":"EBB%20Series.html#compile-firmware","text":"1.After connecting to the Raspberry Pi via ssh, type the below sentences at the command line: cd ~/klipper/ make menuconfig Compile the firmware with the following configuration (if the following options are not available, please update the Klipper firmware source to the latest version).

It has a fixed plate and multiple tool plates that let you quickly change between different print heads. The 2 series is lighter, more compact, and more robust. Feature Highlights\uff08Hermit Crab 2 CAN\uff09 \u00b6 The board contains a \u2018BOOT\u2019 button to enter DFU mode when updating firmware using USB. The thermistor circuit has added protection to prevent the MCU from burning out due to heater cartridge leakage. Interfaces such as I2C and RGB are provided for DIY capabilities. Fan voltage is compatible with various fan types by selecting the suitable voltage. USB power can be isolated from the DC-DC using a jumper. The proximity switch, 2-pin fans, and 4-pin fans support voltage selections of VIN/12V/5V. Heater cartridge and fan ports have reverse protection diodes and fuses that protect MOSFETs from reverse voltage damage. The XT30 power input port supports a higher current and has reverse polarity protection which prevents boards from burning out. Supports 2-wire PT100/PT1000/NTC100K selection. Offers CAN or USB communication. CAN has a selectable 120R terminal resistor via jumper along with an expansion interface. The USB port contains ESD protection which prevents static discharge damage. The 5V and 12V rails each have an eFuse which greatly reduces the risk of circuit damage from short circuits or sparks. A more precise LIS2DW accelerometer allows for an improved resonance compensation.

The thermistor circuit has added protection to prevent the MCU from burning out due to heater cartridge leakage. Interfaces such as I2C and RGB are provided for DIY capabilities. Fan voltage is compatible with various fan types by selecting the suitable voltage. USB power can be isolated from the DC-DC using a jumper. The proximity switch, 2-pin fans, and 4-pin fans support voltage selections of VIN/12V/5V. Heater cartridge and fan ports have reverse protection diodes and fuses that protect MOSFETs from reverse voltage damage. The XT30 power input port supports a higher current and has reverse polarity protection which prevents boards from burning out. Supports 2-wire PT100/PT1000/NTC100K selection. Offers CAN or USB communication. CAN has a selectable 120R terminal resistor via jumper along with an expansion interface. The USB port contains ESD protection which prevents static discharge damage. The 5V and 12V rails each have an eFuse which greatly reduces the risk of circuit damage from short circuits or sparks.

For better viewability please consult the PINS.pdf document. Hardware Configuration \u00b6 Note: The octopus-pro packs a ton of features which necessitates many components and connectors. Given the component and connector density it was not possible to include the silk screen for connector labels on the top. We recommend that you snap a picture of the bottom of the board before starting the installation so that you have a label reference on hand. If you forget to do so then you can always make use of the PINS.pdf file available on our github repo . POWER WIRING \u00b6 The octopus pro provides three separate power inputs: motherboard power, motor power, and bed heater power. This allows a user to use several power supplies with common grounds in order to ensure that they are able to provide the required power to each part of their system. The motherboard power is regulated using a number of switch-mode and low dropout power supplies to provide the supply rails of 12V, 5V and 3.3V. The 12V, 5V and 3.3V rails are made available via various pins on the motherboard. Consult the PINS.pdf document to find a breakout header if you plan to use one of these supply rails. Take note that the 12V rail can supply up to 4A, the 5V up to 8A and the 3.3V up to 1A however, in order to prevent overloading the rails it is not recommended to load them to their maximum capacity since there are already various components on the motherboard which also take their supply from them. Power wiring is as shown below (look on the underside of your board to quickly identify the purpose of each input if the pins file is not on hand). The positive (red) wire from the power supply goes to the terminal marked +. The negative (black) wire from the power supply goes to the terminal marked -. The polarity (+ and -) is also silk screened onto the underside of the board. Note: DO NOT alter the board wiring with the power on and be sure to get the polarity correct otherwise you can damage the motherboard. MCU POWER JUMPER \u00b6 The Octopus can be powered using the USB-C port by inserting the jumper as shown below. This can make it easier to compile and download firmware directly to the motherboard using DFU mode. If you do not connect this jumper then you must provide the board with power via the main input supply if you would like to communicate via USB-C. Hardware Installation \u00b6 AUTOMATIC POWER DOWN WIRING \u00b6 When using the BIGTREETECH Relay V1.2 module, the wiring can be performed as shown in the figure below. Note: Since power will still be supplied to the Relay 1.2 module after it has cut power to the motherboard, it is extremely dangerous to touch the it while the printer is still connected to mains. Always remove all mains power when working on this wiring. BL TOUCH WIRING \u00b6 When using a BL Touch, wire it to the motherboard as shown in the figure below. As always, never perform any work on the motherboard with power applied. POWER LOSS RECOVERY MODULE WIRING \u00b6 When using the BIGTREETECH mini UPS, wire it to the motherboard as shown in the figure below. As always, never perform any work on the motherboard with power applied. RGB LED WIRING \u00b6 When using the motherboard with RGB LEDs you should wire them as shown in the image below. The exact pinout of the connector can be found on the silkscreen on the underside of the motherboard. RASPBERRY PI WIRING \u00b6 The motherboard supports a connection to a Raspberry Pi for printing. There are several connection options available to connect to a raspberry pi. Simplest of all is to connect the raspberry pi directly to the USB-C port which will emulate a virtual serial port on the pi. However, if you have another need for the USB-C port you are still able to connect the raspberry pi to the motherboard using a direct serial connection over UART or SPI. Dedicated UART and SPI pin headers have been made available on the motherboard for this purpose with the pin mappings conveniently printed in silkscreen on the underside of the board for each. It is beyond the scope of this manual to detail exactly how to connect the raspberry pi to either of these headers however there is an abundance of material online that explains how to interface a raspberry pi to an external device over either of these serial busses. 5V power for the raspberry pi is provided via the dedicated Raspberry pi header (UART2). Consult the PINS.pdf document for the exact pinout of this header. PROBE PORT WIRING \u00b6 The probe port has been provided to allow users to interface bed probes directly to the motherboard without the need for a BAT85 diode to act as a protection against high voltages. The probe signal pin connects to an internal optocoupler that in turn triggers the pin connected to the microcontroller. Depending on the type of probe you are using, you may need to add a jumper to activate the internal 12k pull up resistor between the probe positive voltage rail and the probe signal pin. This will be the case if you are using an \u201cNPN\u201d style probe where the output pulls to ground when it is active. You can tell this by checking the output of your probe using a multimeter. If it floats when it is not active (with nothing else connected to it) and then goes to ground when it is active, it is an NPN style probe. If it goes to the positive rail when active then it is a PNP style probe. The image below shows where the jumper to activate the 12k pull up resistor is located. Regardless of the kind of probe you are using, you will need to enable the internal pulldown resistor on the probe input pin in order for it to generate an output signal. Please refer to the pin configuration instructions for the specific firmware that you are using to find out how to enable a pull down resistor on the probe input pin (PC5). Refer to Section 4.2 for further information on how to configure the voltage used by the probe port. STEPPER DRIVER OPERATIONAL MODES \u00b6 STEP/DIR MODE \u00b6 If you are using drivers that do not support configuration over a serial port then you will need to operate them in step/dir mode and set the jumpers beneath the stepper driver according to the microstepping you desire. Each driver will have its own microstepping table so we do not attempt to speak on behalf of the driver manufacturer in our manual. Please consult the datasheet of your driver to determine what signals need to be applied to the microstepping configuration pins in order to achieve the microstepping you desire. Nevertheless, below you will see a figure which will help you to identify which jumpers correspond to the pins that your drivers will use to configure microstepping and we have additionally included a section in appendix A1 which contains the microstepping tables for some of the most common drivers. This should be viewed as a convenience to the user and we still recommend that you consult the datasheet of your driver manufacturer. In the above image the red rectangle isolates the groups of driver pins. For the purpose of running the drivers in step/dir mode the pinout can be described as per the table below. Note that this is not the actual pinout but rather a simplification for step/dir mode. Connecting jumpers between the lower two rows will set the middle pin (MS) to 5V except for the jumpers in the first column where it will connect SLP and RST. Note that if your stepper driver requires 0V to be present on any of the pins then there is actually no need to connect a jumper to that pin when running in step/dir mode and connecting a jumper in this instance could cause interference since those lines are used for the SPI bus. Note that if you use an A4988 or a DRV8825 driver, you must connect RST and SLP. For details, please click: https://z1996xm.github.io/BIGTREETECH/Tutorials.html UART MODE \u00b6 When using a driver in UART mode, connect the jumpers beneath that driver as show in the image below. SPI MODE \u00b6 When using a driver in SPI mode, connect the jumpers beneath that driver as shown in the image below. MOTHERBOARD JUMPER SETTINGS \u00b6 MOTOR POWER SELECTION JUMPERS \u00b6 Each motor driver on the octopus pro can have the voltage used by it configured via a jumper. Note: Before powering your octopus pro, always double check the driver voltage jumpers to ensure that the correct voltage is being routed to each driver. Sending a high voltage to a driver that is not rated for it is likely to destroy it and may even cause damage to the motherboard. Setting the jumper for any given driver to the right, as shown in the image below, will provide the motherboard input voltage for that driver to use. Generally the motherboard uses 24V. Setting the jumper for any given driver to the left, as shown in the image below, will provide the motor input voltage for that driver to use. This can be up to 60V. Note: Never remove or insert a jumper when power is applied to either the board input or the motor input. FAN AND PROXIMITY SWITCH VOLTAGE SETTINGS \u00b6 The Octopus features 6 PWM fan outputs and two \u201calways on\u201d fan outputs. There is also a dedicated pin header for a proximity sensor or probe. All of the fan outputs and the proximity sensor input can individually have the voltage supplied by their pin header selected by configuring the jumpers associated with each header. Configure the jumpers as below to select 24V (note that all are shown in the same configuration even though they can be individually configured). Configure the jumpers as below to select 12V. Configure the jumpers as below for 5V. Note: Since the jumpers carry a voltage rail directly from one of the regulators or from the input, if you short the jumpers in any way other than the shown connections, you will likely cause damage to the motherboard. When connecting the fan, make sure that you connect the positive terminal to the positive output as shown in the images. STALLGUARD JUMPER SETTINGS \u00b6 The \u201cdiag\u201d jumpers which are used to connect the diagnostic output pin to the endstop inputs for drivers which support the stallguard feature (TMC2209/TMC2226, etc\u2026) can be found in the location shown in the image below. The exact diag numbering can be found by looking at the pins file or the silkscreen beneath the board. PT100/PT1000 DIP SWITCHES \u00b6 The PT100 amplifier supports 2,3 and 4 wire connections to the board. However, the DIP switch needs to be configured for the setup that you are using. You can find the DIP switch in the location shown in the image below. Note that the DIP switch has switch numbers and the \u201con\u201d position printed on it. Select the connection arrangement for your thermistor according to the table below. Bear in mind that you will still need to configure your firmware using the correct sense resistor values which will be 430\uf057 for the PT100 and 4300\uf057 for the PT1000. 1 2 3 4 Sensor model ON ON ON OFF Two-wire PT100 ON ON OFF ON Two-wire PT1000 OFF ON ON OFF Three-wire PT100 OFF ON OFF ON Three-wire PT1000 If you are using a three-wire arrangement, then you will also need to make a small adjustment to an SMD resistor on the board. The image below shows the factory default resistor setting in the blue box (2/4 wire arrangement). Using a 3 wire arrangement will require you to move the resistor from the blue box into the red box and then to leave the pads in the blue box unpopulated. These resistors are 0\uf057 so if you do not feel comfortable soldering them back in place you can always just create a solder bridge between the pads instead, selecting the pads appropriate to your arrangement. Software Installation \u00b6 COMMUNICATING WITH THE MOTHERBOARD \u00b6 After connecting the motherboard to a computer via a USB cable, the driver will be automatically installed (windows, linux and macos). Upon installation of the driver the motherboard should automatically enumerate as a virtual serial device which can be used for data transfer. If it fails to do so, you can visit our GitHub website: https://github.com/bigtreetech?tab=repositories and find the corresponding repository to download the driver. If you would like to confirm that the driver has been installed correctly you can access the device manager in windows and look for a virtual com port when the motherboard is plugged in. In the image below the motherboard has been assigned COM7 however your operating system may assign it any available COM port number. Other operating systems will list serial ports in a different manner. MOTHERBOARD FIRMWARE SUPPORT \u00b6 Marlin, Klipper and RRF (429 variant) all support the Octopus Pro. You can compile and configure you firmware variant of choice according to the methods specified by the developers of that firmware. In time, configuration files for different firmware distributions will be made available on the octopus-pro github . Covering how to compile firmware using VSCode is beyond the scope of this manual however there is an abundance of information online which explains how to set up VSCode on your machine and how to configure Marlin thereafter. Good places to start are provided for your convenience in the links below: \u2022 https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio_vscode.html \u2022 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq_ygvHF29I Once you have either compiled your own version of Marlin or downloaded a pre-compiled version, you can install it by following the steps below: Make sure that the firmware binary is named \u201cfirmware.bin\u201d. Any other name will be rejected by the bootloader. Use an SD card that has been formatted using the SD formatter tool here: https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/ Copy the firmware binary file to the SD card. Insert the SD card into the motherboard and reset it. Remove the SD card and check that the file has changed name to \u201cFIRMWARE.CUR\u201d. This will confirm that the firmware was successfully installed. If you are using Klipper then please ensure that you have the following settings enabled for the 446 variant. Take careful note of the crystal oscillator frequency which is 12MHz and differs from the 429 variant. The 429 variant of the board makes use of a different frequency crystal oscillator (8MHz) and therefore the klipper configuration needs to be adjusted slightly as show in in the image below. PRECAUTIONS \u00b6 The precautions listed in this section should not be overlooked. They have been included as reminders to prevent damage to your motherboard. Never work on the motherboard with power applied. Always double check all jumpers and wiring before applying power. Improper jumpers or wiring can cause damage to the motherboard and possibly even peripherals that it interfaces with. The motherboard can power heated beds up to 300W. If you are using a bed that operates at a higher power then you will need to use an external MOSFET. Do not connect a voltage source greater than 28V to this input. Never short circuit the 3.3V, 5V, 12V or 24V supplies to each other. Doing so will let out some smoke and BTT will not be able to put it back for you. You cannot power external devices using the USB-C interface. It is designed for data only. Always consult the PIN.pdf diagram when making jumper connections or wiring changes. Assuming a connection order may result in damage to the motherboard. It is recommended to update the firmware using SD card. Using DFU (direct programming via the USB port) will overwrite the bootloader meaning that you will no longer have the option to update via SD card unless you reflash the bootloader.

Supports running Klipper and Marlin. Interfaces with a Raspberry Pi using emulated serial over USB or direct UART to any of the serial ports on the board. Supports up to 4 hotend heaters. Provides separate power inputs for motors, bed heating and logic/fans/hotends. Supports 12V or 24V supply inputs (12V only supported on motor and bed. Logic must be > 14.1V) with built in 12V (4A), 5V (8A) and 3.3V (1A) regulators to provide rails for peripheral use. Up to 6 PWM fans and 2 always-on fans with the ability to individually select the voltage rail that will drive each fan. Select from Vin, 12V or 5V. Flyback protection on PWM fan ports \u2013 Many people find that their fan ports become damaged after some time when using larger fans. This is because of the inductance in the fan coils. The octopus includes flyback protection on each fan port which will protect the FETs from damage caused by turning the fans on and off. Includes USB-C interface which supports an emulated serial port that allows printing via USB. Supports all versions of BIGTREETECH TFT screens and LCD12864 screens. Supports multiple languages such as English and Simplified Chinese and can easily switch between different languages (when using the BTT TFT). Includes a bootloader that allows firmware upgrades via the SD card. This offers a simple, efficient, and convenient way to update the firmware. Uses high-performance MOSFETs to increase heating efficiency while also reducing heat generation on the motherboard. Uses easily replaceable fuses Supports \u201cprint from SD card\u201d and \u201cprint via USB OTG\u201d using the integrated USB-A port. Provides two stepper outputs, connected in parallel, to the Z driver allowing for a parallel, dual Z axis drive. Supports firmware update via DFU mode. This is where the firmware is sent to the board directly from the PC and does not require a bootloader however this method is not recommended for novice users as discussed later in this document. Includes an onboard, 32K EEPROM (AT24C32). Provides an RGB LED interface. Provides a WiFi interface for ESP8266 based modules. Provides a DIY PT100 interface. In order to enable the interface a user would need to purchase an INA826AIDR amplifier in the SPO 8 package separately and solder it in place on the board. The connector and passive circuitry are already provided. All that is required is the amplifier IC. Thermistor input protection. This allows you to short a thermistor input directly to a voltage source (not that this makes it a good habit to pick up) up to Vin without causing damage to the motherboard. Allows unused thermistor inputs to be used as general purpose inputs by providing an input pin for each that bypasses the protection circuit. Supports BL Touch and various other ABL sensors. Provides a dedicated \u201cPROBE\u201d port for bed probes. This port is internally protected via an optocoupler which means that you don\u2019t need to use a BAT85 diode. Supports CAN BUS using a 6P6C RJ11 interface, which offers the board the ability to interface with future expansion modules. Supports StallGuard for sensorless homing with TMC drivers Provides an SPI expansion port which can connect the SPI-based expansion modules such as MAX31865 module.

This allows a user to use several power supplies with common grounds in order to ensure that they are able to provide the required power to each part of their system. The motherboard power is regulated using a number of switch-mode and low dropout power supplies to provide the supply rails of 12V, 5V and 3.3V.

MCU POWER JUMPER \u00b6 The Octopus can be powered using the USB-C port by inserting the jumper as shown below. This can make it easier to compile and download firmware directly to the motherboard using DFU mode. If you do not connect this jumper then you must provide the board with power via the main input supply if you would like to communicate via USB-C Hardware Installation \u00b6 AUTOMATIC POWER DOWN WIRING \u00b6 When using the BIGTREETECH Relay V1.2 module, the wiring can be performed as shown in the figure below. Note: Since power will still be supplied to the Relay 1.2 module after it has cut power to the motherboard, it is extremely dangerous to touch the Relay 1.2 module while the printer is still connected to mains. Always remove all mains power when working on this wiring. BL TOUCH WIRING \u00b6 When using a BL Touch, wire it to the motherboard as shown in the figure below. As always, never perform any work on the motherboard with power applied. POWER LOSS RECOVERY MODULE WIRING \u00b6 When using the BIGTREETECH mini UPS, wire it to the motherboard as shown in the figure below. As always, never perform any work on the motherboard with power applied. RGB LED WIRING \u00b6 When using the motherboard with RGB LEDs you should wire them as shown in the image below. The exact pinout of the connector can be found on the silkscreen on the underside of the motherboard. RASPBERRY PI WIRING \u00b6 Note: The 3.3V and GND pins for the SPI3 port were erroneously swapped on the silkscreen on the underside of some early boards. To be sure of the exact pinout please reference the PIN.pdf document for the SPI3 port. The motherboard supports a connection to a Raspberry Pi for printing. There are several connection options available to connect to a raspberry pi. Simplest of all is to connect the raspberry pi directly to the USB-C port which will emulate a virtual serial port on the pi. However, if you have another need for the USB-C port you are still able to connect the raspberry pi to the motherboard using a direct serial connection over UART or SPI.

Consult the PINS.pdf document for the exact pinout of this header. PROBE PORT WIRING \u00b6 The probe port has been provided to allow users to interface bed probes directly to the motherboard without the need for a BAT85 diode to act as a protection against high voltages. The probe signal pin connects to an internal optocoupler that in turn triggers the pin connected to the microcontroller. Depending on the type of probe you are using, you may need to add an external 4k7 pull up resistor between the probe positive voltage rail and the probe signal pin in order to get a reading. This will be the case if you are using an \u201cNPN\u201d style probe where the output pulls to ground when it is active. You can tell this by checking the output of your probe using a multimeter. If it floats when it is not active (with nothing else connected to it) and then goes to ground when it is active, it is an NPN style probe. If it goes to the positive rail when active then it is a PNP style probe. The image below shows how to connect the external 4k7 resistor when using an NPN probe.

Please refer to the pin configuration instructions for the specific firmware that you are using to find out how to enable a pull down resistor on the probe input pin. STEPPER DRIVER OPERATIONAL MODES \u00b6 Note: The octopus packs a ton of features which means there are many connectors and components. In order to keep the board size to a minimum we placed the stepper sockets close to each other. This means that drivers will have a snug fit. STEP/DIR MODE \u00b6 If you are using drivers that do not support configuration over a serial port then you will need to operate them in step/dir mode and set the jumpers beneath the stepper driver according to the microstepping you desire. Each driver will have its own microstepping table so we do not attempt to speak on behalf of the driver manufacturer in our guide. Please consult the datasheet of your driver to determine what signals need to be applied to the microstepping configuration pins in order to achieve the microstepping you desire. Nevertheless, below you will see a figure which will help you to identify which jumpers correspond to the pins that your drivers will use to configure microstepping and we have additionally included a section in appendix A1 which contains the microstepping tables for some of the most common drivers. This should be viewed as a convenience to the user and we still recommend that you consult the datasheet of your driver manufacturer. In the above image the red rectangle isolates one group of driver pins. For the purpose of running the drivers in step/dir mode the pinout can be described as per the table below (note that this is not the actual pinout but rather a simplification for step/dir mode). Connecting jumpers between the upper two rows will set the middle pin (MS) to 0V. Connecting jumpers between the lower two rows will set the middle pin (MS) to 3.3V except for the jumpers in the first column where it will connect SLP and RST. Note that if you are using drivers in step/dir mode that use a microstepping factor other than 16 then you cannot use any other drivers in SPI mode since the pins that are required to set the microstepping to anything other than 16 are also shared with SPI. Note that if you use an A4988 or a DRV8825 driver, you must connect RST and SLP. For details, please click: https://bigtreetech.github.io/docs/Tutorials.html UART MODE \u00b6 When using a driver in UART mode, connect the jumpers beneath that driver as show in the image below. SPI MODE \u00b6 When using a driver in SPI mode, connect the jumpers beneath that driver as shown in the image below. MOTHERBOARD JUMPER SETTINGS \u00b6 FAN AND PROXIMITY SWITCH SETTINGS \u00b6 The Octopus features 6 PWM fan outputs and two \u201calways on\u201d fan outputs. There is also a dedicated pin header for a proximity sensor. These headers are shown in the image below. Note: The polarity of the fan ports was erroneously swapped on the silkscreen on the underside of some early boards. To be sure of the correct polarity, please consult the PINS.pdf document or see the images below. All of the fan outputs and the proximity sensor input can individually have the voltage supplied by their pin header selected by configuring the jumpers associated with each header. Configure the jumpers as below to select 12V. Configure the jumpers as below for 5V. Note: Since the jumpers carry a voltage rail directly from one of the regulators or from the input, if you short the jumpers in any way other than the shown connections, you will likely cause damage to the motherboard. When connecting the fan, make sure that you connect the positive terminal to the positive output as shown in the images. STALLGUARD JUMPER SETTINGS \u00b6 The \u201cdiag\u201d jumpers which are used to connect the diagnostic output pin to the endstop inputs for drivers which support the stallguard feature (TMC2209/TMC2226) can be found in the location shown in the image below. The exact diag numbering can be found by looking at the pins file or the silkscreen beneath the board. SPECIAL NOTE ON EXPANSION INTERFACES \u00b6 Expansion interfaces are provided for SPI, UART and I2C. In the very first production run of the Octopus the silkscreen on the underside of the PCB had two pins that were mislabeled on the SPI3 interface and two on the Raspberry Pi UART interface. To be sure that you are connecting your peripheral correctly, please refer to the PINS.pdf document if using the SPI or UART interface. Software Installation \u00b6 COMMUNICATING WITH THE MOTHERBOARD \u00b6 After connecting the motherboard to a computer via a USB cable, the driver will be automatically installed (windows, linux and macos). Upon installation of the driver the motherboard should automatically enumerate as a virtual serial device which can be used for data transfer. If it fails to do so, you can visit our GitHub website: https://github.com/bigtreetech?tab=repositories and find the corresponding repository to download the driver. If you would like to confirm that the driver has been installed correctly you can access the device manager in windows and look for a virtual com port when the motherboard is plugged in. In the image below the motherboard has been assigned COM7 however your operating system may assign it any available COM port number. Other operating systems will list serial ports in a different manner. MOTHERBOARD FIRMWARE SUPPORT \u00b6 You can find a pre-compiled version of Marlin for the Octopus by visiting https://github.com/bigtreetech?tab=repositories and looking for the Octopus repository. Alternately you can compile your own version using VScode. Covering how to compile firmware using VSCode is beyond the scope of this manual however there is an abundance of information online which explains how to set up VSCode on your machine and how to configure Marlin thereafter. Good places to start are provided for your convenience in the links below: \u2022 https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio_vscode.html \u2022 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq_ygvHF29I Once you have either compiled your own version of Marlin or downloaded a pre-compiled version, you can install it by following the steps below: Make sure that the firmware binary is named \u201cfirmware.bin\u201d. Any other name will be rejected by the bootloader. Use an SD card that has been formatted using the SD formatter tool here: https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/ Copy the firmware binary file to the SD card. Insert the SD card into the motherboard and reset it. Remove the SD card and check that the file has changed name to \u201cFIRMWARE.CUR\u201d. This will confirm that the firmware was successfully installed. If you are using Klipper then please ensure that you have the following settings enabled in order to download the firmware to the board while preserving the factory bootloader: PRECAUTIONS \u00b6 The precautions listed in this section should not be overlooked. They have been included as reminders to prevent damage to your motherboard. Never work on the motherboard with power applied. Always double check all jumpers and wiring before applying power. Improper jumpers or wiring can cause damage to the motherboard and possibly even peripherals that it interfaces with. The motherboard can power heated beds up to 300W. If you are using a bed that operates at a higher power then you will need to use an external MOSFET. Always consult the PIN.pdf diagram when making jumper connections or wiring changes. Assuming a connection order may result in damage to the motherboard. It is recommended to update the firmware using SD card. Using DFU (direct programming via the USB port) will overwrite the bootloader meaning that you will no longer have the option to update via SD card. The stock Octopus does not come with a INA826AIDR amplifier chip. If you want to use the PT100 interface, you need to purchase a INA826AIDR chip (SOP-8 Package) separately and solder the chip into the correct position as shown below. The silkscreen on the first production run of the octopus had incorrectly labeled pins on the connectors listed below. To be sure that you are wiring on the correct pins please use the PINS.pdf document when using any of these connectors. The silkscreen has been corrected and all subsequent Octopus boards will reflect the correct mapping. a. Fans b. SPI3 c. Raspberry pi UART.

Supports running Klipper and Marlin. Interfaces with a Raspberry Pi using emulated serial over USB or direct UART to any of the serial ports on the board. Supports up to 4 hotend heaters. Provides separate power inputs for motors, bed heating and logic/fans/hotends. Supports 12V or 24V supply inputs (12V only supported on motor and bed. Logic must be > 14.1V) with built in 12V (4A), 5V (8A) and 3.3V (1A) regulators to provide rails for peripheral use. Up to 6 PWM fans and 2 always-on fans with the ability to individually select the voltage rail that will drive each fan. Select from Vin, 12V or 5V. Flyback protection on PWM fan ports \u2013 Many people find that their fan ports become damaged after some time when using larger fans. This is because of the inductance in the fan coils. The octopus includes flyback protection on each fan port which will protect the FETs from damage caused by turning the fans on and off. Includes USB-C interface which supports an emulated serial port that allows printing via USB. Supports all versions of BIGTREETECH TFT screens and LCD12864 screens. Supports multiple languages such as English and Simplified Chinese and can easily switch between different languages (when using the BTT TFT). Includes a bootloader that allows firmware upgrades via the SD card. This offers a simple, efficient, and convenient way to update the firmware. Uses high-performance MOSFETs to increase heating efficiency while also reducing heat generation on the motherboard. Uses easily replaceable fuses Supports \u201cprint from SD card\u201d and \u201cprint via USB OTG\u201d using the integrated USB-A port. Provides two stepper outputs, connected in parallel, to the Z driver allowing for a parallel, dual Z axis drive. Supports firmware update via DFU mode. This is where the firmware is sent to the board directly from the PC and does not require a bootloader however this method is not recommended for novice users as discussed later in this document. Includes an onboard, 32K EEPROM (AT24C32). Provides an RGB LED interface. Provides a WiFi interface for ESP8266 based modules. Provides a DIY PT100 interface. In order to enable the interface a user would need to purchase an INA826AIDR amplifier in the SPO 8 package separately and solder it in place on the board. The connector and passive circuitry are already provided. All that is required is the amplifier IC. Thermistor input protection. This allows you to short a thermistor input directly to a voltage source (not that this makes it a good habit to pick up) up to Vin without causing damage to the motherboard. Allows unused thermistor inputs to be used as general purpose inputs by providing an input pin for each that bypasses the protection circuit. Supports BL Touch and various other ABL sensors. Provides a dedicated \u201cPROBE\u201d port for bed probes. This port is internally protected via an optocoupler which means that you don\u2019t need to use a BAT85 diode. Supports CAN BUS using a 6P6C RJ11 interface, which offers the board the ability to interface with future expansion modules. Supports StallGuard for sensorless homing with TMC drivers Provides an SPI expansion port which can connect the SPI-based expansion modules such as MAX31865 module. Supports the shutdown after printing function. Supports the power loss print resume function Includes inputs for up to 6 endstop switches and 2 filament runout interfaces.

There are several connection options available to connect to a raspberry pi. Simplest of all is to connect the raspberry pi directly to the USB-C port which will emulate a virtual serial port on the pi. However, if you have another need for the USB-C port you are still able to connect the raspberry pi to the motherboard using a direct serial connection over UART or SPI. Dedicated UART and SPI pin headers have been made available on the motherboard for this purpose with the pin mappings conveniently printed in silkscreen on the underside of the board for each.

The probe signal pin connects to an internal optocoupler that in turn triggers the pin connected to the microcontroller. Depending on the type of probe you are using, you may need to add an external 4k7 pull up resistor between the probe positive voltage rail and the probe signal pin in order to get a reading. This will be the case if you are using an \u201cNPN\u201d style probe where the output pulls to ground when it is active. You can tell this by checking the output of your probe using a multimeter. If it floats when it is not active (with nothing else connected to it) and then goes to ground when it is active, it is an NPN style probe. If it goes to the positive rail when active then it is a PNP style probe. The image below shows how to connect the external 4k7 resistor when using an NPN probe. Regardless of the kind of probe you are using, you will need to enable the internal pulldown resistor on the probe input pin in order for it to generate an output signal.

Follow the steps below to replace the KlipperScreen: 1.Open the moonraker.conf file in Mainsail. 2.Change the origin of KlipperScreen from the official https://github.com/jordanruthe/KlipperScreen.git to: https://github.com/bigtreetech/KlipperScreen.git If you want to use the official version instead of BigTreeTech's, simply change the link back. 3.Click the refresh button in the upper right corner of the Update Manager, then Hard Recovery KlipperScreen. 4.Wait for the update to complete. Setting up SPI to CAN As explained in \"Pad 7 Settings\" section, set the overlays to include mcp2515 to enable the CAN functionality automatically after booting. Setting up ADXL345 As explained in \"Pad 7 Settings\" section, set the overlays to include spidev1_1. After booting, the system user space should load spidev1.1. Add the following configuration to the printer.cfg file to use the ADXL345: [mcu CB1] serial: /tmp/klipper_host_mcu [adxl345] cs_pin: CB1:None spi_bus: spidev1.1 axes_map: z,y,-x # Modify according to the actual orientation of the ADXL345 installed on the printer. To Work with a CM4 \u00b6 We recommend using the OS image released by Mainsail: https://github.com/mainsail-crew/MainsailOS/releases The steps for burning the system are the same as with CB1. Setting up Backlight Note: The backlight IO of CM4 does not have PWM function, so it can only be set to maximum brightness. 1.Remove \"console=serial0,115200\" from /boot/cmdline.txt file (if it exists). 2.Remove enable_uart=1 from /boot/config.txt file (if it exists). 3.Add the following lines to /boot/config.txt file: dtoverlay=gpio-led dtparam=gpio=14,label=Pad7-lcd,active_low=1 Setting up Resolution and Touch 1.Add the following lines to /boot/config.txt file to specify the HDMI output resolution: hdmi_group=2 hdmi_mode=87 hdmi_cvt 1024 600 60 6 0 0 0 hdmi_drive=1 Some versions of the system disable USB by default to save power.

A normal situation is shown in the figure. ADXL345 Not Working \u00b6 1.Check the CS-Choose switch inside Pad 7. When used with CB1, it should be set to the CB1 position, and when used with CM4, it should be set to the CM4 position. 2.Check the wiring sequence of the SPI port according to the \u201cConnection between Pad7, EBB36, and ADXL345\u201d section of this manual. 3.In the SSH terminal, execute the command \"ls /dev/spi*\" to check if CB1 has a device named \"spidev1.1\" and if CM4 has a device named \"spidev0.1\". Cautions \u00b6 Do not attempt to hot-swap the TF card. Make sure it is properly inserted before powering on the device. We advise customers not to disassemble the device as they may not be familiar with the internal structure, which can lead to internal circuit breakdown. Any problems caused by disassembling will not be covered by compensation. If you need to replace the core board, follow the replacement steps provided (see \"To Replace CB1 with CM4\" section). When wiring the SPI interface to the expansion module, pay close attention to the silkscreen to avoid short circuits.

Bigtreetech will monitor all beta firmware versions and if we find a firmware version that affects Panda Touch functionality we will send out an alert via email, Aliexpress chat and our social channels. Buyers can then decide whether or not they would like to perform the update at the risk of losing functionality. Note that the Panda Touch warranty does not cover lost functionality due to a Bambu Lab firmware update being performed. IMPORTANT USAGE INFORMATION \u00b6 When using \"LAN Only\" mode, firmware versions below V1.05.01.00 on the P1P/S will only allow either the Panda Touch or Bambu Studio to connect to the printer at one time. Firmware versions above that will allow both connections simultaneously. When using \"Cloud\" mode, firmware versions below V1.05.01.00 on the P1P/S will allow both Bambu Studio and the Panda Touch to connect simultaneously. However, they will not allow a third device such as Home Assistant to connect. Firmware versions above that will allow all three simultaneous connections. Please check the firmware listing in the product page description to ensure that your printer firmware is compatible with the Panda Touch. Updating printer firmware to an incompatible version that may limit the functionality of the Panda Touch is not covered under the Warranty. MicroSD card and USB drive files can currently only be read from the root directory and will only be recognized when models are sliced in Build Plate #1 in Bambu Studio and are in 3mf format. When running on its built-in lithium battery, the Panda Touch has a battery life of 30 minutes. To maintain the battery and extend the lifespan of the product, it is advised to charge the Panda Touch or turn it off as soon as the battery runs out. The screen may flicker when the lithium battery is low on power. This flickering is normal and acts as a warning to users that the battery is almost empty. Users should then promptly charge the battery or turn off the Panda Touch. If you plan to turn your printer on and off frequently then we recommend running the Panda Touch on USB direct mode. This bypasses the battery and prevents the battery from being taken through many charge-discharge cycles. If you want to run off the battery then simply flick the switch on the back of the Panda Touch to the battery power mode.

Wiring and Power Connection \u00b6 Remove the foam covering the USB port on the printer to access the port. Thread the Charging Cable through the hole on the right side of the printer, then plug the USB-C end into the power input of the Charging Dock. Insert the USB-A end of the charging cable into the USB port on the printer to connect the power supply. Then arrange the cable in the clip as shown. You have three options on the rear power switch. In the OFF position, the battery will charge but the Panda Touch will not be powered up. When switched to the battery position, the USB will charge the battery and power the Panda Touch at the same time. If the Panda Touch is removed from the dock then the battery will take over and power it for up to 30 minutes. Upon being returned to the dock, the USB will once again resume charging and powering the Panda Touch. This mode is recommended for users who do not turn their printer on and off often. Note that there is no battery charge level indicator. The Panda Touch has been designed for brief periods of use away from a dock and not for prolonged mobile use. When switched to the DC 5V position, the Panda Touch is powered directly from the USB input, while still charging the battery. Removing it from the dock will power it off without the Panda Touch draining the battery. This mode is recommended for users who often turn their printer on and off as it will preserve battery charge cycles. If such users wish to use the Panda Touch in a portable mode then they can flip the switch to battery power after removing it from the dock. Panda Touch has been successfully installed and powered on. Please follow the on-screen instructions for the next setup step. User Interface Instructions \u00b6 First time connection guide \u00b6 You will be presented with the screen below after booting for the first time or after executing the Restore Factory Settings command. WiFi connection guide \u00b6 During the initial setup the Panda Touch will scan for WiFi networks and then display upt to 20 networks with the best signal strength. If you cannot find your desired network in the list then tap Refresh and the Panda Touch will rescan for WiFi networks. Note: The current version ( V1.0.1 ) of the firmware does not support connecting to hidden WiFi networks. Also, when Panda Touch is connecting to WiFi, Panda Touch cannot perform the WiFi scanning task at the same time. Click on the WiFi name in the list, and the keyboard interface will pop up. After entering the correct password, click \"OK\" to start connecting to WiFi. (Password length: 8~64 characters) The connection status will be displayed next to the name of the WiFi network. A Spinner graphic means that WiFi is still attempting a connection, and a \u2714 means the connection is successful. After the connection is successful, the Next button will be enabled. Click Next to enter the printer connection menu. Printer connection menu \u00b6 There are two possible methods to connect the Panda Touch to a printer. Automatic Scanning (recommended). Manual data entry. Automatic Scanning \u00b6 For automatic scanning simply tap the Scan button. Bambu Lab printers that are on the same WiFi network will be displayed in the scan results with the Name , Printer IP , SN and Model information pre-populated. Pre-populating these fields helps to make adding printers easier and can result in fewer mistakes due to manual data input errors. The only data that you will need to enter is the Access Code which can be found within the printer WiFi/LAN menu. Instructions on how to find your access code will be displayed on the Panda Touch screen. Printers which have previously been connected to the Panda Touch will still be displayed in the scan results however the Panda Touch will not allow them to be added again and Already added will be displayed near to the printer icon. Once you have entered your access code you can confirm the connection or manually add some of the data below. Manual Data Entry \u00b6 You can click on the printer icon on the left to enter the menu for selecting the printer model. You must set it according to the actual model of the printer you are connecting to. The Panda Touch will also perform some checks in the background to confirm the model. The available models are as follows: P1P P1S X1C A1 mini A1 After selecting a model using the icon, the content in the Model field will be filled with the corresponding model name. After selecting the printer model, there are 4 required fields. These fields contain information necessary to connect to and identify the printer. Tap the i icon and swipe left and right for instructions on how to find this information on your printer. Name : a custom name for users to identify the printer. (length: 1~15 characters) Printer IP : for Panda Touch to connect to printer. (length: 7~15 characters) Access Code : for Panda Touch to connect to printer. (length: 8 characters) SN : for Panda Touch to connect to printer. (length: 15 characters) There are 5 optional fields which may help you to identify certain parameters of the printer during later use. Model : The model name identifies the exact model of the printer and defines what picture is associated with it. P1P , P1S , X1C , A1 mini , A1 , or customized. (length: 0~15 characters) Filament Color : The color of the filament used by the printer. (length: 0~6 characters) Filament Material : The material of the filament used by the printer. (length: 0~6 characters) Nozzle Diameter : The diameter of the nozzle used by the printer. (length: 0~6 characters) Nozzle Material : The type of nozzle used on the printer. (length: 0~6 characters) Confirm button After filling in the required information, you can click the Confirm button to start connecting to the printer. The title bar of the Panda Touch will display the status of the connection. Keyboard interface \u00b6 \u2460: Use this key to hide or show the entered information. \u2461: Switch between upper and lower case letters. \u2462: Switch to `Symbol input`. \u2463: Switch to `Number input`. Letter input : Symbol input Number input Grouping logic (Control Mode) \u00b6 Currently ( V1.0.1 ), the Panda Touch has 4 settable control modes: Master : A single machine that acts as the source of instructions for itself and possibly other machines. The temperature, filament, and file list in the MicroSD Card displayed by Panda Touch are all derived from this printer. Panda Touch requires that a single printer is set at the Master as the source of this information. All controls on Temperature/Axis and Filament menus are in reference to the Master . The Panda Touch will monitor all print error and HMS messages from the Master in the background and either send them to the notification center if they are non-critical or display them with a pop-up if they are critical. You can start print jobs directly on the master using its internal SD memory. Slave : Slave machines will follow the instructions that the user sends to the Master . For example, instructions such as home , heating , setting filament information and load/unload filament will be followed by all slave machines. This design is for batch control of printers in print farms, so it is recommended that the model and filament (AMS) of Slave machines are the same as those of Master . If they are different, please use Slave mode with caution. All controls on Temperature/Axis and Filament menus will take effect on Slave machines. There can be none or multiple Slave machines at the same time. The Panda Touch will monitor all print error and HMS messages from the Slave machines in the background and either send them to the notification center if they are non-critical or display them with a pop-up if they are critical. You can start a print job on a Slave printer using an external USB drive and selecting the slave printer. Sync : An independent machine that does not follow the instructions sent to the master and slave machines. There can be none or multiple Sync machines at the same time. The Panda Touch will monitor all print error and HMS messages from the Sync machines in the background and either send them to the notification center if they are non-critical or display them with a pop-up if they are critical. You can start a print job on a Sync printer using an external USB drive and selecting the slave printer. Currently ( V1.0.1 ) you cannot control sync printers using the Temperature/Axis and Filament menus. They must be temporarily set to Master in order to do this. In a future firmware version the grouping scheme will be adjusted such that this is possible. Disconnected : The Panda Touch will close the connection to any printers in this state and no instructions will be sent to it. Filament Control \u00b6 The Panda Touch allows users to configure the type and colour of the filament being used on their external spool holder and their AMS. Users can also load and unload filamement using this menu. When performing any actions, please ensure that the correct AMS unit and filament slot is selected. You will know that the filament is selected when it has a red border around it. If nothing has been selected then the Load and Unload buttons will be greyed out. Start printing \u00b6 Start printing from USB flash drive \u00b6 Ensure that the file system of the USB flash drive is formatted as FAT32 . Export the .3mf file from either Bambu Studio or Orca Slicer using the Export plate sliced file option. Write the sliced .3mf file to the root directory of the USB flash drive Panda Touch currently ( V1.0.1 ) only supports files are sliced in Build Plate #1 in Bambu Studio. Panda Touch currently ( V1.0.1 ) only supports .3mf files and does not support .gcode files. Panda Touch currently ( V1.0.1 ) only supports reading files in the root directory and does not support reading files in folders. Insert the USB flash drive into the Panda Touch, and then go to the USB flash drive menu. Find the file we want to print in the file list, click on the file name to select the printer(s) and start printing. \u2460: Select or deselect this printer to start the print job. \u2461: Set printing parameters: Bed Leveling Flow Calibration ( P1P and P1S do not have this feature, so these models of printers will not display this option.) Timelapse Use AMS (Panda Touch will automatically identify whether this printer has AMS plugged in and then determine whether this option needs to be displayed.) \u2462\uff1aList of printers selected to start the task. \u2463\uff1aStart printing. Please make sure that the sliced .3mf file is compatible with the selected printers. If using an AMS, please make sure that the filaments in the AMS tray are consistent with those in the sliced .3mf file as there is currently ( V1.0.1 ) no ability to dynamically map filaments at the start of the print. Panda Touch will start to upload the files in the USB flash drive to the root directory of the printer's MicroSD card. Please make sure there is an MicroSD card inserted into the printer. Please ensure that the remaining capacity of the MicroSD card is sufficient to write the files to be uploaded. Printing will begin once the upload is complete. For very large .3mf files the transfer time may take some minutes to each printer. Start printing from the printer's MicroSD card \u00b6 Make sure the MicroSD card is inserted into the Master printer and formatted as FAT32 . Go to the Master printer's MicroSD card menu. Panda Touch currently ( V1.0.1 ) only supports files are sliced in Build Plate #1 in Bambu Studio. Panda Touch currently ( V1.0.1 ) only supports .3mf files and does not support .gcode files. Panda Touch currently ( V1.0.1 ) only supports reading files in the root directory and does not support reading files in folders. The file list displayed in this menu is from the Master printer. If we want to print files from another printer, we can set the printer we want to print to as the Master . Just like the steps in Start printing from USB flash drive , select the printer to start printing. Multiple printing \u00b6 When a printer in the sync state is printing, or multiple printers in other states are printing at the same time, the Panda Touch will display the Multiple printing menu as shown below. The following group controls exist from this menu: \u2460: Turn ON/OFF the chamber LED of the printer in the current print list. \u2461: Stop all print jobs in the current print list. \u2462: Pause/Resume all print jobs in the current print list. HMS (Health Management System) \u00b6 Tap the title bar of Panda Touch, and the HMS notification center menu will expand. When a new HMS notification is detected, Panda Touch will automatically expand the HMS notification center. The upper left corner of the title bar will display the number of the printers that have sent HMS notifications. Click on the corresponding HMS notification to pop up the wiki link QR code for troubleshooting this problem. Click X to ignore this notification. Click Ignore All to ignore all notifications. Note: Currently ( V1.0.1 ) the Panda Touch will ignore notifications from all printers but the X1C. Since the X1C repeatedly sends notification information at regular intervals, ignored notifications may reappear shortly thereafter. Firmware \u00b6 Firmware History \u00b6 V1.0.1 \u00b6 First released factory firmware. Feature requests \u00b6 If there is something that you would like to see in a coming release of the Panda Touch firmware then please let us know by logging a feature request on the official Panda Touch github repo. Request a feature Coming soon \u00b6 The features below are being worked on for the next firmware release: Automatic IP address healing when the router changes an IP of the printer. Changes to grouping to allow more than one group and individual printer access without needing to set it to master. Patch to better handle mesh networks with multiple matching SSIDs. How to update firmware \u00b6 OTA \u00b6 Download the firmware binary file (Download link in Firmware History ) to the device being used to perform the update. This can be a computer or a mobile device running an OS such as iOS or Android. Hereafter it will be referred to as the \"computer\". Connect the Panda Touch to the WiFi on the same LAN as the computer. Find the IP address of the Panda Touch from the Network menu. Enter the Panda Touch's IP address in the computer's browser to access the web UI, and then click \"Update FW\" button. Click the \"Choose File\" button, then select the downloaded firmware binary file. The Panda Touch will automatically start updating. After the update is completed, the Panda Touch will automatically restart and run the new firmware. Finding Your Connection Details \u00b6 P1P & P1S \u00b6 Navigate to \"Settings->WLAN\" on the LCD menu, and click \"OK\". Enter the IP and Access code into the corresponding Panda Touch input boxes (only Access code for automatic scanning). Find \"Settings->Device\" on the screen menu, and click \"OK\". Enter the SN code into the corresponding Panda Touch input boxes. Troubleshooting \u00b6 Connection Troubleshooting \u00b6 Connect failed \u00b6 This prompt means that the Panda Touch cannot establish a connection with the printer. There are generally several which can cause this: The printer and Panda Touch are not on the same LAN - Check if the WiFi connected to the printer and Panda Touch is the same SSID. If not, connect them to the same SSID. The router restricts communication between devices within the LAN - This is usually the case when using the \"guest\" network of a wireless router. It is recommended to the devices to a normal WiFi network instead of a guest WiFi network. Incorrect printer IP address - The incorrect IP address was typed into the Panda Touch or the IP address of the printer has been changed by the router. Check that the IP address within the Panda Touch matches that of the printer. In a future firmware update, the Panda Touch will be able to automatically find and heal connections that have been broken due to the router changing the IP address of the printer. Incorrect printer SN code - An incorrect SN code was entered. Check that the SN of the printer matches that within the Panda Touch. Weak WiFi signal - Both the Panda Touch and printer have icons displaying WiFi signals, please try to ensure as strong a WiFi signal as possible. Authentication failed \u00b6 This prompt means that Panda Touch can establish a connection with the printer but authentication has failed. This is usually caused by an incorrect access code. Please check whether the printer's access code matches the set one. An incorrect access code are usually caused by the following: Input error. Clicking the refresh access code button on the printer resulting in the code changing. Enabling / Disabling the printer's LAN mode resulted in the printer generating a new access code. Exiting or logging back into the Bambu Lab account resulted in the printer generating a new access code. Technical Support \u00b6 Did this page help you?

Its pinning is compatible to a number of legacy drivers. TRINAMICs sophisticated stealthChop2 chopper ensures noiseless operation, maximum efficiency and best motor torque. Its fast current regulation and optional combination with spreadCycle allow for highly dynamic motion. Integrated power-MOSFETs handle motor current up to 1.4A RMS. Protection and diagnostic features support robust and reliable operation. A simple to use UART interface opens up more tuning and control options. Application specific tuning can be stored to OTP memory.

Customers can choose according to your own needs. The user who purchases the step / dir mode driver shall perform the following hardware operations on the driver module before wiring (the user who purchases the UART mode driver does not need any welding operations): Weld J2 as shown in the purple area, and put the driver in UART mode The benefits of UART mode: 1.Motor current can be set arbitrarily by firmware. 2.Micro-steps can be set arbitrarily by firmware (up to 256 actual micro-steps); 3.The actual and interpolated microsteps can be combined to achieve maximum torque. 4.Firmware can dynamically switch stepper motors between stealthChop2 and spreadCycle modes through UART. 5.When the motor is not moving, the standby current of the motor can be reduced dynamically (through UART). Potentiometer regulation instructions: Clockwise Rotating Potentiometer - Reduces Vref, thereby reducing drive current; Counterclockwise rotating potentiometer - Increase Vref, thereby increasing the driving current. The accurate voltage of Vref can only be measured when the main board is supplied with 12V or 24V voltage. The range of Vref value: default value: 1V (+0.2); MAX: 2V; MIN: 0V;Rotating potentiometer must not use too much force to prevent irreversible damage to the potentiometer; when the counter-clockwise rotation reaches the maximum, if it continues to rotate, it will become the minimum; similarly, when the clockwise rotation reaches the minimum, if it continues to rotate, it will become the maximum. Software Configuration \u00b6 For example\uff0c(Marlin-2.0)BIGTREETECH SKR V1.3 \uff1a Configuration.h files TMC2208 - means you want to control SilentStepStick through UART. TMC2208_STANDALONE - does not use UART control but STEP/DIR . TMC2208 SilentStepStick\uff0cIn other words plug and play. Configuration_adv.h files Pins_BIGTREE_SKR_V1.3.h file After the firmware is changed, burned the firmware and check whether the driver is correctly installed is detected. Precautions \u00b6 When hardware chooses UART working mode, cautiously use soldering iron to prevent scalding hands. After treatment, carefully observe whether there is residual tin slag in the module. It must be cleaned up to prevent short circuit burning of the module. Pay attention to the line sequence and IO port when wiring. If the wrong line is connected, the drive will not work.

Basic Parameters \u00b6 Dimensions: TMC5160T Plus: 64 x 56 x 32.55mm; Dimensions: TMC5160T Plus(W/o case): 58 x 50 x 28mm; Drive Chip: TMC5160-TA; Input Voltage (HVIN) : 8V-60V; Maximum Effective Current: 10.6A, Sine Wave Peak Current 15A; Capacitor: 2 x 560uF; Operating Mode: SPI, SD; Sampling Resistor: 22m\u03a9; Interface Diagram \u00b6 Pinout/Function \u00b6 Interface Introduction \u00b6 Installation and Interface \u00b6 Connection methods for common motherboards (e.g., SKR3), use the supplied TMC Driver Adaptor and cables to connect the TMC5160T Plus with SKR3 as shown in the diagram: For EZ series motherboards (e.g., Octopus MAX EZ), use the supplied EZ Driver Adaptor and cables to connect the TMC5160T Plus with Octopus MAX EZ as shown in the diagram: Software Configuration \u00b6 Marlin Firmware Settings \u00b6 Important Note: Currently, only Marlin 2.0 and later firmware versions support TMC5160's SPI mode. Step 1: In the Marlin 2.0 firmware, locate and open the \"Configuration.h\" file, then find the line \"#define MOTHERBOARD XXXXXX\". \"XXXXXX\" represents the model of the board being used. Confirm the motherboard you are using. Step 2: In the Marlin\\src\\pins directory, find the \"pins_xxxxxx.h\" file corresponding to your board (xxxxxx represents the board model), and then locate \"X_CS_PIN\", \"Y_CS_PIN\", \"Z_CS_PIN\", and \"EO_CS_PIN\" within the file. Modify the pin names following these variables to the pins you are using. Step 3: In the file from Step 2, locate \"#define TMC_SW_MOSI XXX\", \"#define TMC_SW_MISO XXX\", and \"#define TMC_SW_SCK XXX\". Change \"XXX\" to the pins you want to use. Step 4: Find and open \"Configuration_adv.h\", then locate \"#define TMC_USE_SW_SPI\" and remove the comment symbols \"//\". Step 5: In the \"Configuration_adv.h\" file, find \"#define X_CURRENT\", \"#define X_MICROSTEPS\", and \"#define X_RSENSE\" and modify the parameters that follow (for each axis being used). The RSENSE value for each used axis should be changed to \"0.022\". Step 6: Set the corresponding axis drive type to \"TMC5160\" in the \"Configuration.h\" file. Klipper Firmware Settings \u00b6 Note: The default sense_resistor in Klipper is 0.075; it needs to be set to 0.022. Precautions \u00b6 Turn off the power before installing the driver to prevent damage. Do not plug or unplug the driver module with power on to avoid damage. Be cautious of polarity when connecting; reversing can cause the driver to burn out. The factory-installed heat sink should not be removed, as doing so will decrease heat dissipation in the absence of thermal interface material. For large currents (greater than 3A), active cooling is required for normal operation. This product uses a 0.022R sampling resistor, so the maximum effective driving current is 10.6A. Pay attention to the power sequence; ensure the driver power is turned on before the logic power. That is, turn on the driver power first, then power on the motherboard. Regardless of whether the driver uses high or low voltage power delivery, the output voltage from the main control board to the drive must not exceed 24V; exceeding this will damage the driver.","title":"TMC5160T Plus"},{"location":"TMC5160TPlus.html#tmc5160t-plus","text":"","title":"TMC5160T Plus"},{"location":"TMC5160TPlus.html#introduction","text":"TMC5160T Plus is a high-power stepper motor driver control module, featuring 8 high-power MOSFETs separately mounted on the board with a maximum voltage of 60V.

WiFi Settings \u00b6 After the OS writes to the SD card, there is a FAT32 partition named BOOT , open system.cfg file with Notpad , Notpad++ or VSCode . Set WIFI_SSID as your actual wifi name and WIFI_PASSWD as your actual wifi password, The space character can be parsed normally without additional escape character. For example: WIFI_SSID=\"CB1 Tester\" Overlays Settings \u00b6 After the OS writes to the SD card, there is a FAT32 partition named BOOT , open BoardEnv.txt file with Notpad , Notpad++ or VSCode . Set as required as shown in the figure below. The default value is console=display , This means that the UART0 of CB1 is used as the debugging port by default. We can use MobaXterm to connect to CB1 by UART0 and debug. If klipper wants to use UART0 to control the motherboard, we need to set it to console=serial , now klippe can use UART0 as /dev/ttyS0 . CB1 will automatically identify the HDMI resolution, but if your HDMI screen cannot report the resolution through the EDID normally, we can forcibly specify the resolution of CB1 output by uncomment extraargs=video and set the actual resolution. For example: BTT-HDMI7 resolution = 1024x600: extraargs=video=HDMI-A-1:1024x600-24@60 BTT-HDMI5 resolution = 800x480: extraargs=video=HDMI-A-1:800x480-24@60 Uncomment overlays=tft35_spi to enable TFT35 SPI screen. Uncomment overlays=mcp2515 to enable MCP2515 spi to canbus module. Uncomment overlays=tft35_spi mcp2515 If you want to use both TFT35 SPI screen and MCP2515 spi to canbus module uncomment the following overlays and parameters to release 'spidev1.1' to user space, And 'spidev1.1' cannot be used together with TFT35_SPI and MCP2515. overlays=spi-spidev param_spidev_spi_bus=1 param_spidev_spi_cs=1 param_spidev_max_freq=1000000 NOTE: TFT35 SPI and MCP2515 multiplex a group of SPI1 SPI1_CLK=PH6 SPI1_MISO=PH8 SPI1_MOSI=PH7 TFT35_SPI_CS=PC7 MCP2515_CS=PC11 MCP2515_IRQ=PC9 SSH Connection \u00b6 Install the ssh application Mobaxterm: https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html Insert the Micro SD card (installed OS) to motherboard, wait for system to load after power on, aprox. 1-2min. the ACT LED on the motherboard will flash continuously after startup successfully.

Compiling Klipper Firmware \u00b6 1\u3001After SSH connects to CB1/Raspberry Pi, enter the following in the command line: \u200b cd ~/klipper/ \u200b make menuconfig \u200b Compile the firmware using the configuration below (if these options are not available, update the Klipper firmware source code to the latest version). \u200b [*] Enable extra low-level configuration options Micro-controller \u200b Architecture (Raspberry Pi RP2040) ---> \u200b If not using Katapult: \u200b Bootloader offset (No bootloader) ---> \u200b Flash chip (W25Q080 with CLKDIV 2) ---> \u200b If using Katapult: \u200b Bootloader offset (16KiB bootloader) ---> \u200b If using USB communication on Type-C: \u200b Communication interface (USB) ---> \u200b If using CAN bus communication: \u200b Communication interface (CAN bus) ---> \u200b (4) CAN RX gpio number \u200b (5) CAN TX gpio number \u200b (1000000) CAN bus speed 2\u3001After configuring, enter \u2018q\u2019 to exit the configuration interface. When asked to save configuration, select \u2018Yes\u2019. 3\u3001Enter make to compile the firmware. When make is completed, the required klipper.bin firmware will be generated in the home/pi/klipper/out folder and can be directly downloaded to the computer on the left side of the SSH software. Firmware Update via KATAPULT \u00b6 1\u3001To use the CAN bus, ensure that the CAN bus cables are properly connected and that the jumper is inserted at the position of the 120R termination resistor. Enter cd ~/Katapult/scripts \u200b and then enter python3 flash_can.py -i can0 -q \u200b to query the CAN bus ID (connect the CAN cable and power-on in advance). As shown in the image below, the UUID of the device is found. 2\u3001Enter python3 flash_can.py -i can0 -f ~/klipper/out/klipper.bin -u be69315a613c replacing the UUID parameter after \"-u\" with the actual UUID on your board. Note: by this point, you should have already compiled klipper.bin using \"make\". Additionally, when selecting the bootloader offset in the Klipper menuconfig, use the 16KiB option since Katapult's Application start offset is 16KiB. The image below shows a successful flashing sequence. 3\u3001Re-enter python3 flash_can.py -i can0 -q to query. At this stage, the \u2018Application\u2019 has changed from Katapult to Klipper, indicating that Klipper is running normally. Firmware Update via DFU \u00b6 Raspberry Pi or CB1 firmware update through DFU: 1\u3001Hold down the Boot button and connect to Raspberry Pi/CB1 with a Type-C cable. This allows the chip to enter DFU mode. 2\u3001In the SSH terminal command line, enter lsusb to query the DFU device ID. 3\u3001Enter cd klipper to navigate to the klipper directory, then enter make flash FLASH_DEVICE=2e8a:0003 to start flashing the firmware (note: replace 2e8a:0003 with the actual device ID obtained in the previous step). 4\u3001After flashing, enter ls/dev/serial/by-id/ to query the device Serial ID (this ID is only available for USB communication, this step can be ignored when using CAN bus communication). 5\u3001If using USB communication, there is no need to manually press the Boot button to enter DFU mode for subsequent updates after the first flashing is completed. Directly enter make flash FLASH_DEVICE=/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Klipper_rp2040_4550357128922FC8-if00 to flash the firmware (note: replace /dev/serial/by-id/xxx with the actual ID obtained in the previous step). 6\u3001If using CAN bus communication, unplug the Type-C data cable after flashing. CAN Bus Configuration \u00b6 For use with BIGTREETECH U2C module: 1\u3001In the SSH terminal, enter sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces.d/can0 and add the following content: allow-hotplug can0 iface can0 can static bitrate 1000000 up ifconfig $IFACE txqueuelen 1024 Set the CAN bus speed to 1M (speed must match the speed set in the firmware (1000000) CAN bus speed). Save the changes (Ctrl + S) and exit (Ctrl + X), then enter sudo reboot to restart Raspberry Pi. 2\u3001Each device on the CAN bus will generate a canbus_uuid based on the MCU's UID. To find each microcontroller device ID, ensure the hardware is powered on and properly wired, then run: ~/klippy-env/bin/python ~/klipper/scripts/canbus_query.py can0 3\u3001If an uninitialized CAN device is detected, the above command will report the device's canbus_uuid: Found canbus_uuid=0e0d81e4210c 4\u3001If Klipper is already running and connected to this device, the canbus_uuid will not be reported. Configuring Klipper \u00b6 1\u3001Access the mainsail web UI by entering the IP address of the BTT Pi or Raspberry Pi into the browser. Using the path shown in the image below, download the reference configuration named sample-bigtreetech-hermit-crab-2-canbus.cfg. If this file is not found, update the Klipper firmware source code to the latest version or use the link to download it from GitHub: https://github.com/bigtreetech/HermitCrab 2\u3001Upload the motherboard configuration file to Configuration Files. 3\u3001Add the Hermit Crab configuration to the printer.cfg file: [include sample-bigtreetech-hermit-crab-2-canbus.cfg] 4\u3001Change the USB serial or CAN UUID within the configuration file to match the actual ID of the motherboard (USB serial or canbus). 5\u3001Configure the specific functions of the module according to the instructions in the following link: https://www.klipper3d.org/Overview.html Precautions \u00b6 1\u3001When using CAN communication, check if this is used as a terminating device (one of the two devices at either end of the bus). If it is, ensure that the 120R position has a jumper inserted. 2\u3001 When wiring, pay attention to the wire sequence and follow the Pin diagram for DIY instructions to avoid reversing the power line or connecting it to the CAN signal since this could cause damage to the Hermit Crab. 3\u3001When flashing the firmware through the USB port without an external power supply, short the VUSB with a jumper to provide working voltage to the module. 4\u3001The load current of the heater cartridge and fan interface should not be greater than the maximum rated current to prevent burning out the MOS tube. FAQ \u00b6 Q: Maximum current for heater cartridge and fan ports. A: Maximum output current for heater cartridge port: 6 A. Fan interface maximum output current: 1A, peak 1.5A. Total current of heater cartridge + driver + fan should be less than 9A. Q: Unable to update firmware through USB interface. A: Ensure to short the VUSB with a jumper, and check that the power indicator light on the motherboard is on.","title":"Hermit Crab 2 Series"},{"location":"locales/en/Hermit%20Crab%202%20Series.html#hermit-crab-2-series","text":"","title":"Hermit Crab 2 Series"},{"location":"locales/en/Hermit%20Crab%202%20Series.html#introduction","text":"The Hermit Crab 2 series is made for fast and simple swapping of print heads on 3D printers.

We have customized installation print parts for KNOMI 2, facilitating its easy installation into your Voron StealthBurner. In particular, our StealthBurner Main Body not only retains the original fan positions but also incorporates a circular ventilation opening at the top, enhancing compatibility and optimizing heat dissipation. DOWNLOAD THE PRINTED PARTS https://github.com/bigtreetech/KNOMI MOUNTING PLATE Before you start the assembly, we recommend preparing these two printed parts in advance. The Mounting Plate is designed with a snap-on feature due to size limitations and considerations for the air duct design. This may cause some wear and tear through repeated disassembling and reassembling. Hence, we suggest printing several extra copies of this part for future use. We conducted a comparative analysis measuring wind speed and acoustic energy levels between the original StealthBurner and our customized version featuring vents and KNOMI 2 add-on. The results showed that both versions performed similarly, indicating that adding KNOMI 2 will not compromise the performance of the StealthBurner.

For better viewability please consult the PINS.pdf document. Hardware Configuration \u00b6 Note: The octopus-pro packs a ton of features which necessitates many components and connectors. Given the component and connector density it was not possible to include the silk screen for connector labels on the top. We recommend that you snap a picture of the bottom of the board before starting the installation so that you have a label reference on hand. If you forget to do so then you can always make use of the PINS.pdf file available on our github repo . POWER WIRING \u00b6 The octopus pro provides three separate power inputs: motherboard power, motor power, and bed heater power. This allows a user to use several power supplies with common grounds in order to ensure that they are able to provide the required power to each part of their system. The motherboard power is regulated using a number of switch-mode and low dropout power supplies to provide the supply rails of 12V, 5V and 3.3V. The 12V, 5V and 3.3V rails are made available via various pins on the motherboard. Consult the PINS.pdf document to find a breakout header if you plan to use one of these supply rails. Take note that the 12V rail can supply up to 4A, the 5V up to 8A and the 3.3V up to 1A however, in order to prevent overloading the rails it is not recommended to load them to their maximum capacity since there are already various components on the motherboard which also take their supply from them. Power wiring is as shown below (look on the underside of your board to quickly identify the purpose of each input if the pins file is not on hand). The positive (red) wire from the power supply goes to the terminal marked +. The negative (black) wire from the power supply goes to the terminal marked -. The polarity (+ and -) is also silk screened onto the underside of the board. Note: DO NOT alter the board wiring with the power on and be sure to get the polarity correct otherwise you can damage the motherboard. MCU POWER JUMPER \u00b6 The Octopus can be powered using the USB-C port by inserting the jumper as shown below. This can make it easier to compile and download firmware directly to the motherboard using DFU mode. If you do not connect this jumper then you must provide the board with power via the main input supply if you would like to communicate via USB-C. Hardware Installation \u00b6 AUTOMATIC POWER DOWN WIRING \u00b6 When using the BIGTREETECH Relay V1.2 module, the wiring can be performed as shown in the figure below. Note: Since power will still be supplied to the Relay 1.2 module after it has cut power to the motherboard, it is extremely dangerous to touch the it while the printer is still connected to mains. Always remove all mains power when working on this wiring. BL TOUCH WIRING \u00b6 When using a BL Touch, wire it to the motherboard as shown in the figure below. As always, never perform any work on the motherboard with power applied. POWER LOSS RECOVERY MODULE WIRING \u00b6 When using the BIGTREETECH mini UPS, wire it to the motherboard as shown in the figure below. As always, never perform any work on the motherboard with power applied. RGB LED WIRING \u00b6 When using the motherboard with RGB LEDs you should wire them as shown in the image below. The exact pinout of the connector can be found on the silkscreen on the underside of the motherboard. RASPBERRY PI WIRING \u00b6 The motherboard supports a connection to a Raspberry Pi for printing. There are several connection options available to connect to a raspberry pi. Simplest of all is to connect the raspberry pi directly to the USB-C port which will emulate a virtual serial port on the pi. However, if you have another need for the USB-C port you are still able to connect the raspberry pi to the motherboard using a direct serial connection over UART or SPI. Dedicated UART and SPI pin headers have been made available on the motherboard for this purpose with the pin mappings conveniently printed in silkscreen on the underside of the board for each. It is beyond the scope of this manual to detail exactly how to connect the raspberry pi to either of these headers however there is an abundance of material online that explains how to interface a raspberry pi to an external device over either of these serial busses. 5V power for the raspberry pi is provided via the dedicated Raspberry pi header (UART2). Consult the PINS.pdf document for the exact pinout of this header. PROBE PORT WIRING \u00b6 The probe port has been provided to allow users to interface bed probes directly to the motherboard without the need for a BAT85 diode to act as a protection against high voltages. The probe signal pin connects to an internal optocoupler that in turn triggers the pin connected to the microcontroller. Depending on the type of probe you are using, you may need to add a jumper to activate the internal 12k pull up resistor between the probe positive voltage rail and the probe signal pin. This will be the case if you are using an \u201cNPN\u201d style probe where the output pulls to ground when it is active. You can tell this by checking the output of your probe using a multimeter. If it floats when it is not active (with nothing else connected to it) and then goes to ground when it is active, it is an NPN style probe. If it goes to the positive rail when active then it is a PNP style probe. The image below shows where the jumper to activate the 12k pull up resistor is located. Regardless of the kind of probe you are using, you will need to enable the internal pulldown resistor on the probe input pin in order for it to generate an output signal. Please refer to the pin configuration instructions for the specific firmware that you are using to find out how to enable a pull down resistor on the probe input pin (PC5). Refer to Section 4.2 for further information on how to configure the voltage used by the probe port. STEPPER DRIVER OPERATIONAL MODES \u00b6 STEP/DIR MODE \u00b6 If you are using drivers that do not support configuration over a serial port then you will need to operate them in step/dir mode and set the jumpers beneath the stepper driver according to the microstepping you desire. Each driver will have its own microstepping table so we do not attempt to speak on behalf of the driver manufacturer in our manual. Please consult the datasheet of your driver to determine what signals need to be applied to the microstepping configuration pins in order to achieve the microstepping you desire. Nevertheless, below you will see a figure which will help you to identify which jumpers correspond to the pins that your drivers will use to configure microstepping and we have additionally included a section in appendix A1 which contains the microstepping tables for some of the most common drivers. This should be viewed as a convenience to the user and we still recommend that you consult the datasheet of your driver manufacturer. In the above image the red rectangle isolates the groups of driver pins. For the purpose of running the drivers in step/dir mode the pinout can be described as per the table below. Note that this is not the actual pinout but rather a simplification for step/dir mode. Connecting jumpers between the lower two rows will set the middle pin (MS) to 5V except for the jumpers in the first column where it will connect SLP and RST. Note that if your stepper driver requires 0V to be present on any of the pins then there is actually no need to connect a jumper to that pin when running in step/dir mode and connecting a jumper in this instance could cause interference since those lines are used for the SPI bus. Note that if you use an A4988 or a DRV8825 driver, you must connect RST and SLP. For details, please click: https://z1996xm.github.io/BIGTREETECH/Tutorials.html UART MODE \u00b6 When using a driver in UART mode, connect the jumpers beneath that driver as show in the image below. SPI MODE \u00b6 When using a driver in SPI mode, connect the jumpers beneath that driver as shown in the image below. MOTHERBOARD JUMPER SETTINGS \u00b6 MOTOR POWER SELECTION JUMPERS \u00b6 Each motor driver on the octopus pro can have the voltage used by it configured via a jumper. Note: Before powering your octopus pro, always double check the driver voltage jumpers to ensure that the correct voltage is being routed to each driver. Sending a high voltage to a driver that is not rated for it is likely to destroy it and may even cause damage to the motherboard. Setting the jumper for any given driver to the right, as shown in the image below, will provide the motherboard input voltage for that driver to use. Generally the motherboard uses 24V. Setting the jumper for any given driver to the left, as shown in the image below, will provide the motor input voltage for that driver to use. This can be up to 60V. Note: Never remove or insert a jumper when power is applied to either the board input or the motor input. FAN AND PROXIMITY SWITCH VOLTAGE SETTINGS \u00b6 The Octopus features 6 PWM fan outputs and two \u201calways on\u201d fan outputs. There is also a dedicated pin header for a proximity sensor or probe. All of the fan outputs and the proximity sensor input can individually have the voltage supplied by their pin header selected by configuring the jumpers associated with each header. Configure the jumpers as below to select 24V (note that all are shown in the same configuration even though they can be individually configured). Configure the jumpers as below to select 12V. Configure the jumpers as below for 5V. Note: Since the jumpers carry a voltage rail directly from one of the regulators or from the input, if you short the jumpers in any way other than the shown connections, you will likely cause damage to the motherboard. When connecting the fan, make sure that you connect the positive terminal to the positive output as shown in the images. STALLGUARD JUMPER SETTINGS \u00b6 The \u201cdiag\u201d jumpers which are used to connect the diagnostic output pin to the endstop inputs for drivers which support the stallguard feature (TMC2209/TMC2226, etc\u2026) can be found in the location shown in the image below. The exact diag numbering can be found by looking at the pins file or the silkscreen beneath the board. PT100/PT1000 DIP SWITCHES \u00b6 The PT100 amplifier supports 2,3 and 4 wire connections to the board. However, the DIP switch needs to be configured for the setup that you are using. You can find the DIP switch in the location shown in the image below. Note that the DIP switch has switch numbers and the \u201con\u201d position printed on it. Select the connection arrangement for your thermistor according to the table below. Bear in mind that you will still need to configure your firmware using the correct sense resistor values which will be 430\uf057 for the PT100 and 4300\uf057 for the PT1000. 1 2 3 4 Sensor model ON ON ON OFF Two-wire PT100 ON ON OFF ON Two-wire PT1000 OFF ON ON OFF Three-wire PT100 OFF ON OFF ON Three-wire PT1000 If you are using a three-wire arrangement, then you will also need to make a small adjustment to an SMD resistor on the board. The image below shows the factory default resistor setting in the blue box (2/4 wire arrangement). Using a 3 wire arrangement will require you to move the resistor from the blue box into the red box and then to leave the pads in the blue box unpopulated. These resistors are 0\uf057 so if you do not feel comfortable soldering them back in place you can always just create a solder bridge between the pads instead, selecting the pads appropriate to your arrangement. Software Installation \u00b6 COMMUNICATING WITH THE MOTHERBOARD \u00b6 After connecting the motherboard to a computer via a USB cable, the driver will be automatically installed (windows, linux and macos). Upon installation of the driver the motherboard should automatically enumerate as a virtual serial device which can be used for data transfer. If it fails to do so, you can visit our GitHub website: https://github.com/bigtreetech?tab=repositories and find the corresponding repository to download the driver. If you would like to confirm that the driver has been installed correctly you can access the device manager in windows and look for a virtual com port when the motherboard is plugged in. In the image below the motherboard has been assigned COM7 however your operating system may assign it any available COM port number. Other operating systems will list serial ports in a different manner. MOTHERBOARD FIRMWARE SUPPORT \u00b6 Marlin, Klipper and RRF (429 variant) all support the Octopus Pro. You can compile and configure you firmware variant of choice according to the methods specified by the developers of that firmware. In time, configuration files for different firmware distributions will be made available on the octopus-pro github . Covering how to compile firmware using VSCode is beyond the scope of this manual however there is an abundance of information online which explains how to set up VSCode on your machine and how to configure Marlin thereafter. Good places to start are provided for your convenience in the links below: \u2022 https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio_vscode.html \u2022 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq_ygvHF29I Once you have either compiled your own version of Marlin or downloaded a pre-compiled version, you can install it by following the steps below: Make sure that the firmware binary is named \u201cfirmware.bin\u201d. Any other name will be rejected by the bootloader. Use an SD card that has been formatted using the SD formatter tool here: https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/ Copy the firmware binary file to the SD card. Insert the SD card into the motherboard and reset it. Remove the SD card and check that the file has changed name to \u201cFIRMWARE.CUR\u201d. This will confirm that the firmware was successfully installed. If you are using Klipper then please ensure that you have the following settings enabled for the 446 variant. Take careful note of the crystal oscillator frequency which is 12MHz and differs from the 429 variant. The 429 variant of the board makes use of a different frequency crystal oscillator (8MHz) and therefore the klipper configuration needs to be adjusted slightly as show in in the image below. PRECAUTIONS \u00b6 The precautions listed in this section should not be overlooked. They have been included as reminders to prevent damage to your motherboard. Never work on the motherboard with power applied. Always double check all jumpers and wiring before applying power. Improper jumpers or wiring can cause damage to the motherboard and possibly even peripherals that it interfaces with. The motherboard can power heated beds up to 300W. If you are using a bed that operates at a higher power then you will need to use an external MOSFET. Do not connect a voltage source greater than 28V to this input. Never short circuit the 3.3V, 5V, 12V or 24V supplies to each other. Doing so will let out some smoke and BTT will not be able to put it back for you. You cannot power external devices using the USB-C interface. It is designed for data only. Always consult the PIN.pdf diagram when making jumper connections or wiring changes. Assuming a connection order may result in damage to the motherboard. It is recommended to update the firmware using SD card. Using DFU (direct programming via the USB port) will overwrite the bootloader meaning that you will no longer have the option to update via SD card unless you reflash the bootloader.

It is designed and manufactured by the 3D printing team of Shenzhen Bigtree Technology Co.,Ltd Main Features \u00b6 Uses a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 series STM32F446ZET6 main control chip with a core frequency of 180MHz. Supports running Klipper and Marlin. Interfaces with a Raspberry Pi using emulated serial over USB or direct UART to any of the serial ports on the board. Supports up to 4 hotend heaters. Provides separate power inputs for motors, bed heating and logic/fans/hotends. Supports 12V or 24V supply inputs (12V only supported on motor and bed. Logic must be > 14.1V) with built in 12V (4A), 5V (8A) and 3.3V (1A) regulators to provide rails for peripheral use. Up to 6 PWM fans and 2 always-on fans with the ability to individually select the voltage rail that will drive each fan. Select from Vin, 12V or 5V. Flyback protection on PWM fan ports \u2013 Many people find that their fan ports become damaged after some time when using larger fans. This is because of the inductance in the fan coils. The octopus includes flyback protection on each fan port which will protect the FETs from damage caused by turning the fans on and off. Includes USB-C interface which supports an emulated serial port that allows printing via USB. Supports all versions of BIGTREETECH TFT screens and LCD12864 screens. Supports multiple languages such as English and Simplified Chinese and can easily switch between different languages (when using the BTT TFT). Includes a bootloader that allows firmware upgrades via the SD card. This offers a simple, efficient, and convenient way to update the firmware. Uses high-performance MOSFETs to increase heating efficiency while also reducing heat generation on the motherboard. Uses easily replaceable fuses Supports \u201cprint from SD card\u201d and \u201cprint via USB OTG\u201d using the integrated USB-A port. Provides two stepper outputs, connected in parallel, to the Z driver allowing for a parallel, dual Z axis drive. Supports firmware update via DFU mode. This is where the firmware is sent to the board directly from the PC and does not require a bootloader however this method is not recommended for novice users as discussed later in this document. Includes an onboard, 32K EEPROM (AT24C32). Provides an RGB LED interface. Provides a WiFi interface for ESP8266 based modules. Provides a DIY PT100 interface. In order to enable the interface a user would need to purchase an INA826AIDR amplifier in the SPO 8 package separately and solder it in place on the board. The connector and passive circuitry are already provided. All that is required is the amplifier IC. Thermistor input protection. This allows you to short a thermistor input directly to a voltage source (not that this makes it a good habit to pick up) up to Vin without causing damage to the motherboard. Allows unused thermistor inputs to be used as general purpose inputs by providing an input pin for each that bypasses the protection circuit. Supports BL Touch and various other ABL sensors. Provides a dedicated \u201cPROBE\u201d port for bed probes. This port is internally protected via an optocoupler which means that you don\u2019t need to use a BAT85 diode. Supports CAN BUS using a 6P6C RJ11 interface, which offers the board the ability to interface with future expansion modules. Supports StallGuard for sensorless homing with TMC drivers Provides an SPI expansion port which can connect the SPI-based expansion modules such as MAX31865 module. Supports the shutdown after printing function. Supports the power loss print resume function Includes inputs for up to 6 endstop switches and 2 filament runout interfaces.

For better viewability please consult the PINS.pdf document. Hardware Configuration \u00b6 POWER WIRING \u00b6 The octopus provides three separate power inputs: motherboard power, motor power, and bed heater power. This allows a user to use several power supplies with common grounds in order to ensure that they are able to provide the required power to each part of their system. The motherboard power is regulated using a number of switch-mode and low dropout power supplies to provide the supply rails of 12V, 5V and 3.3V. The 12V, 5V and 3.3V rails are made available via various pins on the motherboard. Consult the PINS.pdf document to find a breakout header if you plan to use one of these supply rails. Take note that the 12V rail can supply up to 4A, the 5V up to 8A and the 3.3V up to 1A however, in order to prevent overloading the rails it is not recommended to load them to their maximum capacity since there are already various components on the motherboard which also take their supply from them. Power wiring is as shown below (look on the underside of your board to identify the purpose of each input). The positive (red) wire from the power supply goes to the terminal marked +. The negative (black) wire from the power supply goes to the terminal marked -. The polarity (+ and -) is also silk screened onto the underside of the board as a convenience to the user. Note: DO NOT alter the board wiring with the power on and be sure to get the polarity correct, otherwise you can cause damage to the motherboard. MCU POWER JUMPER \u00b6 The Octopus can be powered using the USB-C port by inserting the jumper as shown below. This can make it easier to compile and download firmware directly to the motherboard using DFU mode. If you do not connect this jumper then you must provide the board with power via the main input supply if you would like to communicate via USB-C Hardware Installation \u00b6 AUTOMATIC POWER DOWN WIRING \u00b6 When using the BIGTREETECH Relay V1.2 module, the wiring can be performed as shown in the figure below. Note: Since power will still be supplied to the Relay 1.2 module after it has cut power to the motherboard, it is extremely dangerous to touch the Relay 1.2 module while the printer is still connected to mains. Always remove all mains power when working on this wiring. BL TOUCH WIRING \u00b6 When using a BL Touch, wire it to the motherboard as shown in the figure below. As always, never perform any work on the motherboard with power applied. POWER LOSS RECOVERY MODULE WIRING \u00b6 When using the BIGTREETECH mini UPS, wire it to the motherboard as shown in the figure below. As always, never perform any work on the motherboard with power applied. RGB LED WIRING \u00b6 When using the motherboard with RGB LEDs you should wire them as shown in the image below. The exact pinout of the connector can be found on the silkscreen on the underside of the motherboard. RASPBERRY PI WIRING \u00b6 Note: The 3.3V and GND pins for the SPI3 port were erroneously swapped on the silkscreen on the underside of some early boards. To be sure of the exact pinout please reference the PIN.pdf document for the SPI3 port. The motherboard supports a connection to a Raspberry Pi for printing. There are several connection options available to connect to a raspberry pi. Simplest of all is to connect the raspberry pi directly to the USB-C port which will emulate a virtual serial port on the pi. However, if you have another need for the USB-C port you are still able to connect the raspberry pi to the motherboard using a direct serial connection over UART or SPI. Dedicated UART and SPI pin headers have been made available on the motherboard for this purpose with the pin mappings conveniently printed in silkscreen on the underside of the board for each. It is beyond the scope of this manual to detail exactly how to connect the raspberry pi to either of these headers however there is an abundance of material online that explains how to interface a raspberry pi to an external device over either of these serial busses. 5V power for the raspberry pi is provided via the dedicated Raspberry pi header. Consult the PINS.pdf document for the exact pinout of this header. PROBE PORT WIRING \u00b6 The probe port has been provided to allow users to interface bed probes directly to the motherboard without the need for a BAT85 diode to act as a protection against high voltages. The probe signal pin connects to an internal optocoupler that in turn triggers the pin connected to the microcontroller. Depending on the type of probe you are using, you may need to add an external 4k7 pull up resistor between the probe positive voltage rail and the probe signal pin in order to get a reading. This will be the case if you are using an \u201cNPN\u201d style probe where the output pulls to ground when it is active. You can tell this by checking the output of your probe using a multimeter. If it floats when it is not active (with nothing else connected to it) and then goes to ground when it is active, it is an NPN style probe. If it goes to the positive rail when active then it is a PNP style probe. The image below shows how to connect the external 4k7 resistor when using an NPN probe. Regardless of the kind of probe you are using, you will need to enable the internal pulldown resistor on the probe input pin in order for it to generate an output signal. Please refer to the pin configuration instructions for the specific firmware that you are using to find out how to enable a pull down resistor on the probe input pin. STEPPER DRIVER OPERATIONAL MODES \u00b6 Note: The octopus packs a ton of features which means there are many connectors and components. In order to keep the board size to a minimum we placed the stepper sockets close to each other. This means that drivers will have a snug fit. STEP/DIR MODE \u00b6 If you are using drivers that do not support configuration over a serial port then you will need to operate them in step/dir mode and set the jumpers beneath the stepper driver according to the microstepping you desire. Each driver will have its own microstepping table so we do not attempt to speak on behalf of the driver manufacturer in our guide. Please consult the datasheet of your driver to determine what signals need to be applied to the microstepping configuration pins in order to achieve the microstepping you desire. Nevertheless, below you will see a figure which will help you to identify which jumpers correspond to the pins that your drivers will use to configure microstepping and we have additionally included a section in appendix A1 which contains the microstepping tables for some of the most common drivers. This should be viewed as a convenience to the user and we still recommend that you consult the datasheet of your driver manufacturer. In the above image the red rectangle isolates one group of driver pins. For the purpose of running the drivers in step/dir mode the pinout can be described as per the table below (note that this is not the actual pinout but rather a simplification for step/dir mode). Connecting jumpers between the upper two rows will set the middle pin (MS) to 0V. Connecting jumpers between the lower two rows will set the middle pin (MS) to 3.3V except for the jumpers in the first column where it will connect SLP and RST. Note that if you are using drivers in step/dir mode that use a microstepping factor other than 16 then you cannot use any other drivers in SPI mode since the pins that are required to set the microstepping to anything other than 16 are also shared with SPI. Note that if you use an A4988 or a DRV8825 driver, you must connect RST and SLP. For details, please click: https://bigtreetech.github.io/docs/Tutorials.html UART MODE \u00b6 When using a driver in UART mode, connect the jumpers beneath that driver as show in the image below. SPI MODE \u00b6 When using a driver in SPI mode, connect the jumpers beneath that driver as shown in the image below. MOTHERBOARD JUMPER SETTINGS \u00b6 FAN AND PROXIMITY SWITCH SETTINGS \u00b6 The Octopus features 6 PWM fan outputs and two \u201calways on\u201d fan outputs. There is also a dedicated pin header for a proximity sensor. These headers are shown in the image below. Note: The polarity of the fan ports was erroneously swapped on the silkscreen on the underside of some early boards. To be sure of the correct polarity, please consult the PINS.pdf document or see the images below. All of the fan outputs and the proximity sensor input can individually have the voltage supplied by their pin header selected by configuring the jumpers associated with each header. Configure the jumpers as below to select 12V. Configure the jumpers as below for 5V. Note: Since the jumpers carry a voltage rail directly from one of the regulators or from the input, if you short the jumpers in any way other than the shown connections, you will likely cause damage to the motherboard. When connecting the fan, make sure that you connect the positive terminal to the positive output as shown in the images. STALLGUARD JUMPER SETTINGS \u00b6 The \u201cdiag\u201d jumpers which are used to connect the diagnostic output pin to the endstop inputs for drivers which support the stallguard feature (TMC2209/TMC2226) can be found in the location shown in the image below. The exact diag numbering can be found by looking at the pins file or the silkscreen beneath the board. SPECIAL NOTE ON EXPANSION INTERFACES \u00b6 Expansion interfaces are provided for SPI, UART and I2C. In the very first production run of the Octopus the silkscreen on the underside of the PCB had two pins that were mislabeled on the SPI3 interface and two on the Raspberry Pi UART interface. To be sure that you are connecting your peripheral correctly, please refer to the PINS.pdf document if using the SPI or UART interface. Software Installation \u00b6 COMMUNICATING WITH THE MOTHERBOARD \u00b6 After connecting the motherboard to a computer via a USB cable, the driver will be automatically installed (windows, linux and macos). Upon installation of the driver the motherboard should automatically enumerate as a virtual serial device which can be used for data transfer. If it fails to do so, you can visit our GitHub website: https://github.com/bigtreetech?tab=repositories and find the corresponding repository to download the driver. If you would like to confirm that the driver has been installed correctly you can access the device manager in windows and look for a virtual com port when the motherboard is plugged in. In the image below the motherboard has been assigned COM7 however your operating system may assign it any available COM port number. Other operating systems will list serial ports in a different manner. MOTHERBOARD FIRMWARE SUPPORT \u00b6 You can find a pre-compiled version of Marlin for the Octopus by visiting https://github.com/bigtreetech?tab=repositories and looking for the Octopus repository. Alternately you can compile your own version using VScode. Covering how to compile firmware using VSCode is beyond the scope of this manual however there is an abundance of information online which explains how to set up VSCode on your machine and how to configure Marlin thereafter. Good places to start are provided for your convenience in the links below: \u2022 https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio_vscode.html \u2022 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq_ygvHF29I Once you have either compiled your own version of Marlin or downloaded a pre-compiled version, you can install it by following the steps below: Make sure that the firmware binary is named \u201cfirmware.bin\u201d.

This will confirm that the firmware was successfully installed. If you are using Klipper then please ensure that you have the following settings enabled in order to download the firmware to the board while preserving the factory bootloader: PRECAUTIONS \u00b6 The precautions listed in this section should not be overlooked. They have been included as reminders to prevent damage to your motherboard. Never work on the motherboard with power applied. Always double check all jumpers and wiring before applying power. Improper jumpers or wiring can cause damage to the motherboard and possibly even peripherals that it interfaces with. The motherboard can power heated beds up to 300W.

The stock Octopus does not come with a INA826AIDR amplifier chip. If you want to use the PT100 interface, you need to purchase a INA826AIDR chip (SOP-8 Package) separately and solder the chip into the correct position as shown below. The silkscreen on the first production run of the octopus had incorrectly labeled pins on the connectors listed below. To be sure that you are wiring on the correct pins please use the PINS.pdf document when using any of these connectors. The silkscreen has been corrected and all subsequent Octopus boards will reflect the correct mapping. a. Fans b. SPI3 c. Raspberry pi UART.

Includes an onboard, 32K EEPROM (AT24C32). Provides an RGB LED interface. Provides a WiFi interface for ESP8266 based modules. Provides a DIY PT100 interface. In order to enable the interface a user would need to purchase an INA826AIDR amplifier in the SPO 8 package separately and solder it in place on the board. The connector and passive circuitry are already provided. All that is required is the amplifier IC. Thermistor input protection. This allows you to short a thermistor input directly to a voltage source (not that this makes it a good habit to pick up) up to Vin without causing damage to the motherboard. Allows unused thermistor inputs to be used as general purpose inputs by providing an input pin for each that bypasses the protection circuit. Supports BL Touch and various other ABL sensors. Provides a dedicated \u201cPROBE\u201d port for bed probes. This port is internally protected via an optocoupler which means that you don\u2019t need to use a BAT85 diode. Supports CAN BUS using a 6P6C RJ11 interface, which offers the board the ability to interface with future expansion modules. Supports StallGuard for sensorless homing with TMC drivers Provides an SPI expansion port which can connect the SPI-based expansion modules such as MAX31865 module. Supports the shutdown after printing function. Supports the power loss print resume function Includes inputs for up to 6 endstop switches and 2 filament runout interfaces. Provides an I2C expansion port for peripherals that communicate using that protocol.","title":"Main Features"},{"location":"locales/en/Octopus.html#basic-parameters","text":"Edge to edge size: 160*100mm Mounting hole to hole size: 150*90mm Microprocessor: ARM 32-bit Cortex\u2122-M4 CPU: STM32F446ZET6 Recommended input voltage: DC24V Motor drivers: Pluggable drivers supporting all popular driver types.

The motherboard power is regulated using a number of switch-mode and low dropout power supplies to provide the supply rails of 12V, 5V and 3.3V. The 12V, 5V and 3.3V rails are made available via various pins on the motherboard. Consult the PINS.pdf document to find a breakout header if you plan to use one of these supply rails. Take note that the 12V rail can supply up to 4A, the 5V up to 8A and the 3.3V up to 1A however, in order to prevent overloading the rails it is not recommended to load them to their maximum capacity since there are already various components on the motherboard which also take their supply from them. Power wiring is as shown below (look on the underside of your board to identify the purpose of each input). The positive (red) wire from the power supply goes to the terminal marked +.

However, if you have another need for the USB-C port you are still able to connect the raspberry pi to the motherboard using a direct serial connection over UART or SPI. Dedicated UART and SPI pin headers have been made available on the motherboard for this purpose with the pin mappings conveniently printed in silkscreen on the underside of the board for each. It is beyond the scope of this manual to detail exactly how to connect the raspberry pi to either of these headers however there is an abundance of material online that explains how to interface a raspberry pi to an external device over either of these serial busses. 5V power for the raspberry pi is provided via the dedicated Raspberry pi header.

The probe signal pin connects to an internal optocoupler that in turn triggers the pin connected to the microcontroller. Depending on the type of probe you are using, you may need to add an external 4k7 pull up resistor between the probe positive voltage rail and the probe signal pin in order to get a reading. This will be the case if you are using an \u201cNPN\u201d style probe where the output pulls to ground when it is active. You can tell this by checking the output of your probe using a multimeter. If it floats when it is not active (with nothing else connected to it) and then goes to ground when it is active, it is an NPN style probe. If it goes to the positive rail when active then it is a PNP style probe. The image below shows how to connect the external 4k7 resistor when using an NPN probe. Regardless of the kind of probe you are using, you will need to enable the internal pulldown resistor on the probe input pin in order for it to generate an output signal.

Be careful not to select the wrong storage device, otherwise the data will be formatted). 4.Wait for the writing process to complete. System Settings \u00b6 Setting Description In the configuration file, the '#' symbol represents a comment, and the system ignores any content that appears after the '#' symbol. As shown in the figure below: #hostname=\"BTT-CB1\" - This line is ignored by the system, and it is equivalent to not being present. hostname=\"BTT-Pad7\" - This line is recognized by the system, and the hostname is set to \"BTT-Pad7\". Setting up WiFi Note: If you are using a wired connection, skip this step. After the OS image has been burned onto the microSD card, a FAT32 partition that is recognized by the computer will be created on the card. Under this partition, there will be a configuration file named \"system.cfg\". Open this file, and replace WIFI-SSID with the actual name of your WIFI network, and PASSWORD with your actual WIFI password. Pad 7 Settings Open the \"BoardEnv.txt\" configuration file, and set the following parameters: overlays=ws2812 light mcp2515 spidev1_1 ws2812: Enables the RGB light located in the upper right corner of the Pad 7. light: Enables the PWM function for the LCD backlight. mcp2515: Enables the MCP2515 SPI to CAN, which provides CAN functionality on the Pad 7. spidev1_1: Enables the spidev1_1 to the system user space, allowing the Pad 7's SPI port to connect to an ADXL345 accelerometer module. Open the \"system.cfg\" configuration file and modify the following settings: BTT_PAD7=\"ON\" # Enables Pad7 related scripts. TOUCH_VIBRATION=\"OFF\" # OFF: Disables vibration feedback. ON: Enables vibration feedback. TOUCH_SOUND=\"ON\" # OFF: Disables sound feedback, ON: Enables sound feedback.

Bigtreetech will monitor all beta firmware versions and if we find a firmware version that affects Panda Touch functionality we will send out an alert via email, Aliexpress chat and our social channels. Buyers can then decide whether or not they would like to perform the update at the risk of losing functionality. Note that the Panda Touch warranty does not cover lost functionality due to a Bambu Lab firmware update being performed. IMPORTANT USAGE INFORMATION \u00b6 When using \"LAN Only\" mode, firmware versions below V1.05.01.00 on the P1P/S will only allow either the Panda Touch or Bambu Studio to connect to the printer at one time. Firmware versions above that will allow both connections simultaneously. When using \"Cloud\" mode, firmware versions below V1.05.01.00 on the P1P/S will allow both Bambu Studio and the Panda Touch to connect simultaneously. However, they will not allow a third device such as Home Assistant to connect. Firmware versions above that will allow all three simultaneous connections. Please check the firmware listing in the product page description to ensure that your printer firmware is compatible with the Panda Touch. Updating printer firmware to an incompatible version that may limit the functionality of the Panda Touch is not covered under the Warranty. MicroSD card and USB drive files can currently only be read from the root directory and will only be recognized when models are sliced in Build Plate #1 in Bambu Studio and are in 3mf format. When running on its built-in lithium battery, the Panda Touch has a battery life of 30 minutes. To maintain the battery and extend the lifespan of the product, it is advised to charge the Panda Touch or turn it off as soon as the battery runs out. The screen may flicker when the lithium battery is low on power. This flickering is normal and acts as a warning to users that the battery is almost empty. Users should then promptly charge the battery or turn off the Panda Touch. If you plan to turn your printer on and off frequently then we recommend running the Panda Touch on USB direct mode. This bypasses the battery and prevents the battery from being taken through many charge-discharge cycles. If you want to run off the battery then simply flick the switch on the back of the Panda Touch to the battery power mode.

Charging Time 1.2 hours Expansion Interfaces I2C (For temperature/humidity sensors supported in future firmware, etc.) USB Drive (For reading 3mf files from USB drives) Assembly Instructions \u00b6 Overview \u00b6 Charging dock \u00b6 The power input has been outfitted with hot-plug protection, allowing users to hot-plug the power supply. Packing list \u00b6 Panda Touch x 1 Mounting Bracket x 1 Magnetic Charging Dock x 1 USB-C Charging Cable x 1 M3x6 Screws x 4 Hex Key x 1 BTT Duck x 1 Installing Panda Touch \u00b6 Use the hex/allen key and the two M3x6 FHCS to assemble the Charging Dock and the Mounting Bracket as shown. Peel off the film from the bottom side of the Mounting Bracket. Ensure the printer surface is clean and free of oil, grease, etc., attach the assembled Charging Dock centrally atop the original screen. Apply pressure to adhere fully and allow 12 hours for optimal adhesion. Attach the Panda Touch to the Charging Dock. Wiring and Power Connection \u00b6 Remove the foam covering the USB port on the printer to access the port. Thread the Charging Cable through the hole on the right side of the printer, then plug the USB-C end into the power input of the Charging Dock. Insert the USB-A end of the charging cable into the USB port on the printer to connect the power supply. Then arrange the cable in the clip as shown. You have three options on the rear power switch. In the OFF position, no power is sent to the Panda Touch and the battery is disconnected. When switched to the battery position, the USB will charge the batter and power the Panda Touch at the same time. If the Panda Touch is removed from the dock then the battery will take over and power it for up to 30 minutes. Upon being returned to the dock, the USB will once again resume charging and powering the Panda Touch. This mode is recommended for users who do not turn their printer on and off often. When switched to the DC 5V position, the Panda Touch is powered directly from the USB input, bypassing the battery. Removing it from the dock will power it off. This mode is recommended for users who often turn their printer on and off as it will preserve battery charge cycles. If such users wish to use the Panda Touch in a portable mode then they can flip the switch to battery power after removing it from the dock. Panda Touch has been successfully installed and powered on. Please follow the on-screen instructions for the next setup step. User Interface Instructions \u00b6 First time connection guide \u00b6 You will be presented with the screen below after booting for the first time or after executing the Restore Factory Settings command. WiFi connection guide \u00b6 During the initial setup the Panda Touch will scan for WiFi networks and then display upt to 20 networks with the best signal strength. If you cannot find your desired network in the list then tap Refresh and the Panda Touch will rescan for WiFi networks. Note: The current version ( V1.0.1 ) of the firmware does not support connecting to hidden WiFi networks. Also, when Panda Touch is connecting to WiFi, Panda Touch cannot perform the WiFi scanning task at the same time. Click on the WiFi name in the list, and the keyboard interface will pop up. After entering the correct password, click \"OK\" to start connecting to WiFi. (Password length: 8~64 characters) The connection status will be displayed next to the name of the WiFi network. A Spinner graphic means that WiFi is still attempting a connection, and a \u2714 means the connection is successful. After the connection is successful, the Next button will be enabled.

Letter input : Symbol input Number input Grouping logic (Control Mode) \u00b6 Currently ( V1.0.1 ), the Panda Touch has 4 settable control modes: Master : A single machine that acts as the source of instructions for itself and possibly other machines. The temperature, filament, and file list in the MicroSD Card displayed by Panda Touch are all derived from this printer. Panda Touch requires that a single printer is set at the Master as the source of this information. All controls on Temperature/Axis and Filament menus are in reference to the Master . The Panda Touch will monitor all print error and HMS messages from the Master in the background and either send them to the notification center if they are non-critical or display them with a pop-up if they are critical. You can start print jobs directly on the master using its internal SD memory. Slave : Slave machines will follow the instructions that the user sends to the Master . For example, instructions such as home , heating , setting filament information and load/unload filament will be followed by all slave machines. This design is for batch control of printers in print farms, so it is recommended that the model and filament (AMS) of Slave machines are the same as those of Master . If they are different, please use Slave mode with caution. All controls on Temperature/Axis and Filament menus will take effect on Slave machines. There can be none or multiple Slave machines at the same time. The Panda Touch will monitor all print error and HMS messages from the Slave machines in the background and either send them to the notification center if they are non-critical or display them with a pop-up if they are critical. You can start a print job on a Slave printer using an external USB drive and selecting the slave printer. Sync : An independent machine that does not follow the instructions sent to the master and slave machines. There can be none or multiple Sync machines at the same time. The Panda Touch will monitor all print error and HMS messages from the Sync machines in the background and either send them to the notification center if they are non-critical or display them with a pop-up if they are critical. You can start a print job on a Sync printer using an external USB drive and selecting the slave printer. Currently ( V1.0.1 ) you cannot control sync printers using the Temperature/Axis and Filament menus. They must be temporarily set to Master in order to do this. In a future firmware version the grouping scheme will be adjusted such that this is possible. Disconnected : The Panda Touch will close the connection to any printers in this state and no instructions will be sent to it. Filament Control \u00b6 The Panda Touch allows users to configure the type and colour of the filament being used on their external spool holder and their AMS. Users can also load and unload filamement using this menu. When performing any actions, please ensure that the correct AMS unit and filament slot is selected. You will know that the filament is selected when it has a red border around it. If nothing has been selected then the Load and Unload buttons will be greyed out. Start printing \u00b6 Start printing from USB flash drive \u00b6 Ensure that the file system of the USB flash drive is formatted as FAT32. Export the .3mf file from either Bambu Studio or Orca Slicer using the Export plate sliced file option. Write the sliced .3mf file to the root directory of the USB flash drive Panda Touch currently ( V1.0.1 ) only supports files are sliced in Build Plate #1 in Bambu Studio. Panda Touch currently ( V1.0.1 ) only supports .3mf files and does not support .gcode files. Panda Touch currently ( V1.0.1 ) only supports reading files in the root directory and does not support reading files in folders. Insert the USB flash drive into the Panda Touch, and then go to the USB flash drive menu. Find the file we want to print in the file list, click on the file name to select the printer(s) and start printing. \u2460: Select or deselect this printer to start the print job. \u2461: Set printing parameters: Bed Leveling Flow Calibration ( P1P and P1S do not have this feature, so these models of printers will not display this option.) Timelapse Use AMS (Panda Touch will automatically identify whether this printer has AMS plugged in and then determine whether this option needs to be displayed.) \u2462\uff1aList of printers selected to start the task. \u2463\uff1aStart printing. Please make sure that the sliced .3mf file is compatible with the selected printers. If using an AMS, please make sure that the filaments in the AMS tray are consistent with those in the sliced .3mf file as there is currently ( V1.0.1 ) no ability to dynamically map filaments at the start of the print. Panda Touch will start to upload the files in the USB flash drive to the root directory of the printer's MicroSD card. Please make sure there is an MicroSD card inserted into the printer. Please ensure that the remaining capacity of the MicroSD card is sufficient to write the files to be uploaded. Printing will begin once the upload is complete. For very large .3mf files the transfer time may take some minutes to each printer. Start printing from the printer's MicroSD card \u00b6 Make sure the MicroSD card is inserted into the Master printer. Go to the Master printer's MicroSD card menu. Panda Touch currently ( V1.0.1 ) only supports files are sliced in Build Plate #1 in Bambu Studio. Panda Touch currently ( V1.0.1 ) only supports .3mf files and does not support .gcode files. Panda Touch currently ( V1.0.1 ) only supports reading files in the root directory and does not support reading files in folders. The file list displayed in this menu is from the Master printer. If we want to print files from another printer, we can set the printer we want to print to as the Master . Just like the steps in Start printing from USB flash drive , select the printer to start printing. Multiple printing \u00b6 When a printer in the sync state is printing, or multiple printers in other states are printing at the same time, the Panda Touch will display the Multiple printing menu as shown below. The following group controls exist from this menu: \u2460: Turn ON/OFF the chamber LED of the printer in the current print list. \u2461: Stop all print jobs in the current print list. \u2462: Pause/Resume all print jobs in the current print list. HMS (Health Management System) \u00b6 Tap the title bar of Panda Touch, and the HMS notification center menu will expand. When a new HMS notification is detected, Panda Touch will automatically expand the HMS notification center. The upper left corner of the title bar will display the number of the printers that have sent HMS notifications. Click on the corresponding HMS notification to pop up the wiki link QR code for troubleshooting this problem. Click X to ignore this notification. Click Ignore All to ignore all notifications. Note: Currently ( V1.0.1 ) the Panda Touch will ignore notifications from all printers but the X1C. Since the X1C repeatedly sends notification information at regular intervals, ignored notifications may reappear shortly thereafter. Firmware \u00b6 Firmware History \u00b6 V1.0.1 \u00b6 First released factory firmware. Feature requests \u00b6 If there is something that you would like to see in a coming release of the Panda Touch firmware then please let us know by logging a feature request on the official Panda Touch github repo. Request a feature Coming soon \u00b6 The features below are being worked on for the next firmware release: Automatic IP address healing when the router changes an IP of the printer. Changes to grouping to allow more than one group and individual printer access without needing to set it to master. Patch to better handle mesh networks with multiple matching SSIDs. How to update firmware \u00b6 OTA \u00b6 Download the firmware binary file (Download link in Firmware History ) to the device being used to perform the update. This can be a computer or a mobile device running an OS such as iOS or Android. Hereafter it will be referred to as the \"computer\". Connect the Panda Touch to the WiFi on the same LAN as the computer. Find the IP address of the Panda Touch from the Network menu. Enter the Panda Touch's IP address in the computer's browser to access the web UI, and then click \"Update FW\" button. Click the \"Choose File\" button, then select the downloaded firmware binary file. The Panda Touch will automatically start updating. After the update is completed, the Panda Touch will automatically restart and run the new firmware. Finding Your Connection Details \u00b6 P1P & P1S \u00b6 Navigate to \"Settings->WLAN\" on the LCD menu, and click \"OK\". Enter the IP and Access code into the corresponding Panda Touch input boxes (only Access code for automatic scanning). Find \"Settings->Device\" on the screen menu, and click \"OK\". Enter the SN code into the corresponding Panda Touch input boxes. Troubleshooting \u00b6 Connection Troubleshooting \u00b6 Connect failed \u00b6 This prompt means that the Panda Touch cannot establish a connection with the printer. There are generally several which can cause this: The printer and Panda Touch are not on the same LAN - Check if the WiFi connected to the printer and Panda Touch is the same SSID. If not, connect them to the same SSID. The router restricts communication between devices within the LAN - This is usually the case when using the \"guest\" network of a wireless router. It is recommended to the devices to a normal WiFi network instead of a guest WiFi network. Incorrect printer IP address - The incorrect IP address was typed into the Panda Touch or the IP address of the printer has been changed by the router. Check that the IP address within the Panda Touch matches that of the printer. In a future firmware update, the Panda Touch will be able to automatically find and heal connections that have been broken due to the router changing the IP address of the printer. Incorrect printer SN code - An incorrect SN code was entered. Check that the SN of the printer matches that within the Panda Touch. Weak WiFi signal - Both the Panda Touch and printer have icons displaying WiFi signals, please try to ensure as strong a WiFi signal as possible. Authentication failed \u00b6 This prompt means that Panda Touch can establish a connection with the printer but authentication has failed. This is usually caused by an incorrect access code. Please check whether the printer's access code matches the set one. An incorrect access code are usually caused by the following: Input error. Clicking the refresh access code button on the printer resulting in the code changing. Enabling / Disabling the printer's LAN mode resulted in the printer generating a new access code. Exiting or logging back into the Bambu Lab account resulted in the printer generating a new access code. Technical Support \u00b6 Did this page help you?

Firmware versions above that will allow both connections simultaneously. When using \"Cloud\" mode, firmware versions below V1.05.01.00 on the P1P/S will allow both Bambu Studio and the Panda Touch to connect simultaneously. However, they will not allow a third device such as Home Assistant to connect. Firmware versions above that will allow all three simultaneous connections. Please check the firmware listing in the product page description to ensure that your printer firmware is compatible with the Panda Touch. Updating printer firmware to an incompatible version that may limit the functionality of the Panda Touch is not covered under the Warranty. MicroSD card and USB drive files can currently only be read from the root directory and will only be recognized when models are sliced in Build Plate #1 in Bambu Studio and are in 3mf format. When running on its built-in lithium battery, the Panda Touch has a battery life of 30 minutes. To maintain the battery and extend the lifespan of the product, it is advised to charge the Panda Touch or turn it off as soon as the battery runs out. The screen may flicker when the lithium battery is low on power. This flickering is normal and acts as a warning to users that the battery is almost empty. Users should then promptly charge the battery or turn off the Panda Touch. If you plan to turn your printer on and off frequently then we recommend running the Panda Touch on USB direct mode. This bypasses the battery and prevents the battery from being taken through many charge-discharge cycles. If you want to run off the battery then simply flick the switch on the back of the Panda Touch to the battery power mode.","title":"IMPORTANT USAGE INFORMATION"},{"location":"locales/en/PandaTouch.html#specifications","text":"MCU Xtensa 32-bit LX7 dual-core ESP32S3R8 up to 240MHz clock speed.

Step 1: In the Marlin 2.0 firmware, locate and open the \"Configuration.h\" file, then find the line \"#define MOTHERBOARD XXXXXX\". \"XXXXXX\" represents the model of the board being used. Confirm the motherboard you are using. Step 2: In the Marlin\\src\\pins directory, find the \"pins_xxxxxx.h\" file corresponding to your board (xxxxxx represents the board model), and then locate \"X_CS_PIN\", \"Y_CS_PIN\", \"Z_CS_PIN\", and \"EO_CS_PIN\" within the file. Modify the pin names following these variables to the pins you are using. Step 3: In the file from Step 2, locate \"#define TMC_SW_MOSI XXX\", \"#define TMC_SW_MISO XXX\", and \"#define TMC_SW_SCK XXX\". Change \"XXX\" to the pins you want to use. Step 4: Find and open \"Configuration_adv.h\", then locate \"#define TMC_USE_SW_SPI\" and remove the comment symbols \"//\". Step 5: In the \"Configuration_adv.h\" file, find \"#define X_CURRENT\", \"#define X_MICROSTEPS\", and \"#define X_RSENSE\" and modify the parameters that follow (for each axis being used). The RSENSE value for each used axis should be changed to \"0.022\". Step 6: Set the corresponding axis drive type to \"TMC5160\" in the \"Configuration.h\" file. Klipper Firmware Settings \u00b6 Note: The default sense_resistor in Klipper is 0.075; it needs to be set to 0.022. Precautions \u00b6 Turn off the power before installing the driver to prevent damage. Do not plug or unplug the driver module with power on to avoid damage. Be cautious of polarity when connecting; reversing can cause the driver to burn out. The factory-installed heat sink should not be removed, as doing so will decrease heat dissipation in the absence of thermal interface material. For large currents (greater than 3A), active cooling is required for normal operation. This product uses a 0.022R sampling resistor, so the maximum effective driving current is 10.6A. Pay attention to the power sequence; ensure the driver power is turned on before the logic power. That is, turn on the driver power first, then power on the motherboard. Regardless of whether the driver uses high or low voltage power delivery, the output voltage from the main control board to the drive must not exceed 24V; exceeding this will damage the driver.","title":"TMC5160T Plus"},{"location":"locales/en/TMC5160TPlus.html#tmc5160t-plus","text":"","title":"TMC5160T Plus"},{"location":"locales/en/TMC5160TPlus.html#introduction","text":"TMC5160T Plus is a high-power stepper motor driver control module, featuring 8 high-power MOSFETs separately mounted on the board with a maximum voltage of 60V.
